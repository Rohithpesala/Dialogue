aaaaa bbbbb there's nothing to tell. it's just some guy i work with.
come on. you're going out with a guy.
there's gotta be something wrong with him.
so does he have a hump and a hair piece?
wait. does he eat chalk?
i don't want her to go through what i went through with carl. oh.
okay, everybody relax. this is not even a date.
it's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.
sounds like a date to me.
i'm back in high school, in the middle of the cafeteria and i realize i'm totally naked.
oh, yeah.
i've had that dream.
then i look down and i realize there is a phone there.
instead of
that's right!
that one, i've never had.  no.
all of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
and it turns out it's my mother.
which is very, very weird because she never calls me.
hi.
this guy says "hello," i wanna kill myself.
are you okay, sweetie?
i feel like someone grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck.
cookie?
carol moved her stuff out today.
oh.
let me get you some coffee.
thanks.
ew. unh.
no. no, don't! stop cleansing my aura.
just leave my aura alone, okay?
i'll be fine. all right? really. i hope she'll be very happy.
no, you don't.
no, i don't.
to hell with her. she left me!
and you never knew she was a lesbian.
no! okay?
why does everyone keep fixating on that?
she didn't know. how should i know?
sometimes i wish i was a lesbian.
did i say that out loud?
all right, ross. look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.
you're angry. you're hurting.
can i tell you what the answer is?
strip joints!
come on, you're single. have some hormones.
see, but i don't want to be single, okay?
i just wanna be married again.
and i just want a million dollars!
rachel?
oh, god, monica! hi! thank god!
i went to your building and this guy with a hammer said that you might be here, and you are.
can i get you some coffee?
decaf.
okay, everybody, this is rachel, another lincoln high survivor.
this is everybody. this is chandler and phoebe and joey. and remember my brother, ross?
sure!
hey.
hi.
oh, god.
so you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
oh, god! well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.
i was in this room with all the presents and i was looking at this gravy boat.
this really gorgeous limoges gravy boat.
when all of a sudden sweet 'n low?
 i realized i was more turned on by this gravy boat than by barry.
then i got really freaked out, 
how much barry looks like mr. potato head.
you know, i mean, i always knew he looked familiar, but anyway, i just had to get out of there, 
why am i doing this?" and "who am i doing this for?"
anyway, i just didn't know where to go, and i know you and i have drifted apart but you're the only person i know in the city.
who wasn't invited to the wedding.
oh, i was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.
i'm guessing he bought her the big pipe organ and she's really not happy about it.
daddy, i just i can't marry him.
i'm sorry.
i just don't love him.
well, it matters to me.
she should not be wearing those pants.
i say push her down the stairs.
push her down the stairs! push her down the stairs!
come on, daddy, listen to me!
it's like all of my life, everyone's always told me, "you're a shoe!
you're a shoe! you're a shoe! you're a shoe!"
then today i stopped and said, "what if i don't wanna be a shoe?
what if i wanna be a purse? you know?
or a hat?"
i don't want you to buy me a hat, i am a hat.
it's a metaphor, daddy!
you can see where he'd have trouble.
look, daddy, it's my life.
well, maybe i'll just stay here with monica.
i guess we've established she's staying with monica.
well, maybe that's my decision.
well, maybe i don't need your money.
wait! wait! i said maybe!
okay. just breathe, that's it.
just try to think of nice, calm things.
doorbells and sleigh bells and something with mittens
la la la something with string
i'm all better now.
i helped.
look, this is probably for the best, you know?
independence. taking control of your life.
and, hey, if you need anything, you can always come to joey.
me and chandler live right across the hall. and he's away a lot.
joey, stop hitting on her. it's her wedding day.
what? like there's a rule or something?
please don't do that again. it's a horrible sound.
uh, it's paul.
buzz him in.
who's paul?
paul, the wine guy, paul?
maybe.
wait a minute. your "not a real date" is with paul, the wine guy?
he finally asked you out?
yes.
ooh. this is a "dear diary" moment.
rach, wait, i can cancel.
please, no. go, i'll be fine.
ross, are you okay? i mean, do you want me to stay?
that'd be good.
really?
no, go on! it's paul, the wine guy.
hi, come in. paul, this is everybody. everybody, this is paul.
paul, the wine guy.
wine guy.
i didn't catch your name. paul, was it?
okay. sit down. two seconds.
okay.
ooh, i just pulled out four eyelashes. that can't be good.
so, rachel, what are you up to tonight?
well, i was supposed to be headed for aruba on my honeymoon so, nothing.
right. you're not even getting your honeymoon.
god. no, no. although, aruba. heh. this time of year? eh.
talk about your big lizards.
anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight joey and chandler are helping me with my furniture.
yes, and we're very excited about it.
actually, thanks, but i'm just gonna hang out here tonight.
it's been a long day.
oh, sure. okay. sure.
hey, pheebs, you wanna help?
oh, i wish i could, but i don't want to.
i'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things using a bunch of these little worm guys.
i have no bracket-y thing, i see no worm guys whatsoever and i cannot feel my legs.
what's this?
i have no idea.
done with the bookcase.
all finished.
this was carol's favorite beer.
she always drank it out of the can. i should have known.
hey. ross, let me ask you a question.
she got the furniture, the stereo, the good tv.
what did you get?
you guys.
oh, god. oh, my god.
you got screwed.
oh, my god.
i know, i know. i'm such an idiot.
i should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week.
i mean, how clean can teeth get?
my brother's going through that. he's such a mess.
how did you get through it?
he might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers.
say her
leg?
heh. that's one way of going through it, yeah.
me, i went for the watch.
you actually broke her watch?
mm.
barry, i'm sorry. i am so sorry.
you probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.
it isn't, it's about me. and i hi. machine cut me off again. anyway you know what's scary? what if there's only one woman for everybody?
i mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?
unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.
what are you talking about? one woman.
that's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.
let me tell you something, ross. there's lots of flavors out there.
there's rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.
you can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.
this is the best thing that ever happened to you.
you got married. you were like, what, 8?
welcome back to the world. grab a spoon.
i honestly don't know if i'm hungry or horny.
then stay out of my freezer.
ever since she walked out on me, i
what? what?
you wanna spell it out with noodles?
no, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.
oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?
isn't there?
yeah, yeah. i think there is.
what were you gonna say?
well er, uh ever since she left me, um i haven't been able to perform sexually.
oh, god! oh, god! i am so
i'm so sorry.
it's okay.
being spit on is probably not what you need right now.
um
how long?
two years.
wow!
i'm glad you smashed her watch.
so you still think you might want that fifth date?
yeah.
yeah, i do.
i, joanie, take you, charles, as my lawful husband.
do you take joanie?
oh! see.
but joanie loved chachi. that's the difference.
grab a spoon."
do you know long it's been since i grabbed a spoon?
do the words, "billy, don't be a hero," mean anything to you?
you know, here's the thing. even if i could get it together enough to ask a woman out who am i gonna ask?
isn't this amazing?
i mean, i have never made coffee before in my life.
that is amazing.
congratulations.
while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make a western omelet or something although, actually i'm really not that hungry this morning.
good morning.  good morning.
morning.  morning.
morning.  morning, paul.
hello, paul.
hi. paul, is it?
i had a really great time last night.
thank you. thank you so much.
we'll talk later, okay?
yeah.
thank you.
that wasn't a real date.
what the hell do you do on a real date?
shut up and put my table back.  okay.
all right, kids, i gotta get to work.
if i don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference.
so, like, you guys all have jobs?
yeah, we all have jobs.
see, that's how we buy stuff.
yeah, i'm an actor.
wow. would i have seen you in anything?
oh, i doubt it. mostly regional work.
unless you happened to catch the wee one's production of pinocchio.
look, geppeto. i'm a real live boy."
i will not take this abuse.
you're right. i'm sorry.
so how are you doing today? did you sleep okay?
did you talk to barry? i can't stop smiling.
i can see that. you look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
i know. he's just so
remember you and tony de marco?
oh, yeah.
well, it's like that. with feelings.
oh, wow, are you in trouble!
okay, okay. i am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day.
or else i'm just gonna get up and go to work.
oh, wish me luck!
what for?
i'm gonna go get one of those job things.
hey, monica.
hey, franny. welcome back.
how was florida?
you had sex, didn't you?
how do you do that?
so, who?
you know paul?
paul, the wine guy?
oh, yeah, i know paul.
you mean, you know paul like i know paul?
are you kidding? i take credit for paul.
before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
of course it was a line.
why? why would anybody do something like that?
we're looking for an answer 
to get you into bed."
is it me?
is it like i have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
all right, come here. give me your feet.
i just thought he was nice, you know?
i can't believe you didn't know it was a line.
guess what.
you got a job?
are you kidding?
i'm trained for nothing.
i was laughed out of 12 interviews today.
yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
well, you would be too if you found joan and david boots on sale 50 percent off.
oh, how well you know me.
they're my new "i don't need a job or my parents.
i've got great boots" boots.
how'd you pay for them?
uh, credit card.
and who pays for that?
um, my father.
you can't live off your parents your whole life.
i know that. that's why i was getting married.
give her a break. it's hard being on your own for the first time.
thank you.
you're welcome.
i remember when i first came to this city, i was 14.
my mom had killed herself and my stepdad was back in prison.
and i got here, and i didn't know anybody.
i ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields outside port authority. and then he killed himself.
and then i found aromatherapy. so believe me, i know exactly how you feel.
the word you're looking for is:
anyway"
all right. you ready?
i don't think so.  oh, come on.
cut. cut.
cut, cut, cut.
hey.  all right.
welcome to the real world.
it sucks. you're gonna love it.
well, that's it. you gonna crash on the couch?
no. no, i gotta go home sometime.
are you gonna be okay?
yeah.
look what i just found on the floor.
what?
that's paul's watch.
you can just put it back where you found it.
oh, boy. all right. good night, everybody.
good night.
hmm.
hmm.
oh, sorry.
no. oh, no. go.
no, have it, really.
split it?
okay.
okay.
thanks.
you probably didn't know this, but back in high school i had a major crush on you.
i knew.
you did? oh.
i figured you thought i was monica's geeky older brother.
i did.
oh.
listen, do you think and try not to let my vulnerability become any kind of a factor here.
do you think it would be okay if i ask you out sometime, maybe?
yeah.
maybe.
okay.
okay, maybe i will.
good night.
good night.
see you.
mm-hm.
wait, wait. hey, what's with you?
i just grabbed a spoon.
can't believe what i'm hearing.
what? i said you had
what? i said you had
would you stop?
oh, was i doing it again?
yes.
would anybody like more coffee?
did you make it or are you just serving it?
i'm just serving it.  i'll have a cup of coffee.
kids, new dream.
i'm in las vegas. i'm liza minnelli.
what you guys don't understand is for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
yeah, right.
you serious?
oh, yeah.
everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
absolutely.
yeah, i think, for us kissing is pretty much like an opening act.
i mean, it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out.
yeah, and it's not that we don't like the comedian.
it's just that that's not why we bought the ticket.
see, the problem is, though after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was you girls are always looking for the comedian again.
i mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic basically just trying to stay awake.
bring back the comedian.
otherwise, you're gonna find yourself sitting at home listening to that album alone.
are we still talking about sex?
no, it's good. it is good.
it's just that, doesn't she seem a little angry?
well, she has issues.
does she?
he's out banging other women over the head with a club while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet.
marsha, see, these are cave people.
okay, they have issues like:
gee, that glacier's getting kind of close." see?
speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
no, no.
yes, it is. carol, hi.
okay. yes. yes, it is.
how about i'll catch up with you in the ice age?
hi.
hi.
so
you look great.
i hate that.
sorry. thanks. you look good too.
well, you know, in here, anyone who stands erect
so, what's new? still a
a lesbian?
well
you never know.
how's, um? how's the family?
marty's still totally paranoid.
oh, and
carol, why are you here, carol?
i'm pregnant.
pregnant.
oh. looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all.
i think this is the episode of three's company where's there's some kind of misunderstanding.
then i've already seen this one.
are you through with that? thanks.
yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
whose little ball of paper is this?
oh, that would be mine.
see, i wrote a note to myself, then i didn't need it.
so i balled it up and now i wish i was dead.
she already fluffed that pillow. monica, you know, you already fluffed
but it's fine.
look, i'm sorry.
i don't want to give them any more ammunition than they have.
yes, we know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
monica? hi. um
monica, um, you're scaring me.
i mean, you're, like, all chaotic and twirly, you know?
not in a good way.
yeah, calm down.
you don't see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
that's because, as far as my parents are concerned, ross can do no wrong.
you see, he's the prince.
apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born.
ew, ew, ew.
what?
ugly naked guy got a thighmaster.
ew.
has anybody seen my engagement ring?
yeah, it's beautiful.
oh, god. oh, god.
oh, god, oh, god, oh, god.
no, don't touch that.
oh, like i wasn't dreading tomorrow enough having to give it back to him.
hi, barry, remember me? i'm the girl that stomped on your heart in front of your entire family"
oh, god. now i'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring which makes it so much harder.
easy, rach, we'll find it. won't we?
oh, yeah.  okay, look.
when did you have it on last?
doy. probably right before she lost it.
you don't get a lot of "doy" these days.
i know i had it this morning.
i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with
dinah?
oh, don't be mad.
you didn't.
oh, i'm sorry.
i gave you one job.
oh, but look how straight those noodles are.
monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna.
i just can't do it.
boys?
we're going in.
hi.
oh, that is not a happy "hi."
carol's pregnant.
oh, i found it.
well, what? what?
yeah.
do that for another two hours you might be where i am right about now.
kind of puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, mon?
well, now, how do you fit into this whole thing?
well, carol says she and susan want me to be involved.
but if i'm not comfortable with it, i don't have to be involved.
basically, it's totally up to me.
she is so great. i miss her.
what does she mean by "involved"?
i mean, presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
anyway, they want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
so, what are you gonna do?
i have no idea.
no matter what i do, though, i'm still gonna be a father.
well, this is still ruined, right?
oh. martha lugwin's daughter is gonna call you.
mm. what's that curry taste?
curry.
mm.
i think they're great. i really do.
you remember the lugwins?
the big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
they all had a thing for him.
oh, mom.
i'm sorry. why is this girl going to call me?
oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking or food or i don't know.
anyway, i told her you had a restaurant, so no, mom. i don't have a restaurant. i work in a restaurant.
well, they don't have to know that.
ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti.
yes.
oh, we're having spaghetti. that's easy.
i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish on my part but were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing?
because i think it might take some of the heat off me.
what that rachel did to her life. we ran into her parents at the club.
they were not playing very well.
i'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding but $40,000 is a lot of money.
well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.
what's that supposed to mean?
nothing.
it's an expression.
no, it's not.
don't listen to your mother.
you're independent and you always have been.
even when you were a kid, and you were chubby and you had no friends, you were just fine.
you'd read alone in your room. and your puzzles look, there are people, like ross, who need to shoot for the stars.
with his museum and his papers getting published.
other people are satisfied with staying where they are.
i'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
and i read about these women trying to have it all, and i thank god our little harmonica doesn't seem to have that problem.
so, ross, what's going on with you?
any stories? no news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
okay, okay.
ahem. look, i, uh i realize you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me.
and so, well, here's the deal.
carol's a lesbian.
she's living with a woman named susan.
she's pregnant with my child.
and she and susan are going to raise the baby.
and you knew about this?
your folks are really that bad, huh?
well, you know, these people are pros.
they know what they're doing. they take their time.
they get the job done.
boy, i know they say that you can't change your parents.
boy, if you could, i'd want yours.
must pee.
you know, it's even worse when you're twins.
you're a twin?
oh, yeah. we don't speak.
she's like this high-powered, driven, career-type.
what does she do?
she's a waitress.
all right. you guys, i kind of gotta clean up now.
chandler, you're an only child, right? you don't have any of this.
well, no, although i did have an imaginary friend who my parents actually preferred.
hit the lights, please.
how long was i in there?
i'm just cleaning up.
oh, do you, uh? do you need any help?
um, okay, sure. thanks.
anyway
so you nervous about barry tomorrow?
oh, a little.
mm-hm.
a lot.
mm-hm.
so got any advice?
you know, as someone who's recently been dumped.
well, you may want to steer clear of the word "dumped."
chances are he's going to be this broken shell of a man. you know?
so you should try not to look too terrific. i know it'll be hard.
or, you know, hey, i'll go down there, and i'll give barry back his ring.
and you can go with carol and susan to the ob-gyn.
you've got carol tomorrow.
when did it get so complicated?
got me.
remember when we were in high school?
yeah.
i mean, didn't you think you' were gonna meet someone fall in love, and that'd be it?
ross?
yes, yes.
oh. man. i never thought i'd be here.
me neither.
hi. sorry i'm late. i got stuck at work.
there was this big dinosaur thing. anyway
hi.
ross, you remember susan.
how could i forget?
ross.
hello, susan. good shake, good shake.
so, uh, we're just waiting for?
dr. oberman.
dr. oberman. okay, and is he?
she.
of course, "she."
she, uh, familiar with our special situation?
yes, and she's very supportive.
great. okay, that's great. heh.
no, i'm  thanks.
quack, quack quack, quack, quack.
ross?
that opens my cervix.
barry?  come on in.
are you sure?
it's fine, it's fine. robbie's gonna be here for hours.
huh?
so how are you doing?
i'm
i'm okay.
you look great.
yeah, well  dr. farber, jason greenspan's gagging.
be right there. i'll be back in a second.
i dumped him.
okay.
oh!
ross.
so, um? so how's this going to work ahem, you know, with us?
you know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
give me a "for instance."
well, i don't know. okay, okay.
how about with the baby's name?
marlon
marlon. if it's a boy. minnie, if it's a girl.
as in "mouse"?
as in my grandmother.
still, you say "minnie," you hear "mouse."
how about, um
how about "julia"?
julia.
we agreed on minnie.
it's funny, um, we agreed we'd spend our lives together.
things change. roll with the punches.
i believe julia's on the table.
oh. sorry about that.
so, what have you been up to?
oh. not much.
i got a job.
hey, that's great.
why are you so tan?
oh, i, uh
i went to aruba.
oh, no. you went on our honeymoon alone?
no.
see, uh, i went with
now, this may hurt.
me?
no.
i went with mindy.
mindy?
my maid of honor, mindy?
yeah, well, we're kind of a thing now.
well, i'm
you got plugs.
careful, careful. they haven't quite taken yet.
and you got lenses.
but you hate sticking your finger in your eye.
not for her.
oh.
listen, i really wanted to thank you.
okay.
about a month ago, i wanted to hurt you more than i've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life.
and i'm an orthodontist.
wow.
you know, you were right. i mean, i thought we were happy.
we weren't happy.
but with mindy now i'm happy.
spit.
what?
me.
anyway, um
i guess, uh i guess this belongs to you.
and thank you for giving it to me.
well, thank you for giving it back.
hello.
oh, please. what's wrong with helen?
helen geller?
i don't think so.
hello, it's not gonna be helen geller.
thank you.
no. i mean, it's not geller.
what, it's gonna be helen willick?
no, actually, um, we talked about helen willick bunch.
well, wait a minute. why is she in the title?
because it's my baby too.
that's funny. really? i don't remember you making any sperm.
and we all know what a challenge that is.
uh-huh. see?
all right, you two, stop it.
no, no. she gets a credit. hey, i'm in there too.
honestly. you're not actually suggesting helen willick bunch geller.
i think that borders on child abuse.
of course not. i'm suggesting geller willick bunch.
oh, no. no, no, no. you see what he's doing?
he knows no one is gonna say all those names.
he knows they'll wind up calling her geller. then he gets his way.
my way? you think this is my way?
believe me, of all the ways i ever imagined this moment in my life being this is not my way. you know what? this is too hard.
knock, knock. how are we today? any nausea?
a little.
just a little.
well, i was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but, uh, thanks for sharing.
uh, lie back.
you know what? i'm gonna go.
um, i don't think i can be involved in this particular family thing.
oh, my god.
look at that.
i know.
well, isn't that amazing?
what are we supposed to be seeing here?
i don't know, but i think it's about to attack the enterprise.
you know, if you tilt your head to the left and relax your eyes it kind of looks like an old potato.
then don't do that, all right?
monica?
what do you think?
mm-hm.
are you welling up?
no.
you are.
you are. you're welling up.
no, i'm not.
you're gonna be an aunt.
oh, shut up.
hi, mindy.
hi, it's rachel.
yeah, i'm fine. i saw barry today.
oh, yeah, yeah, he told me.
no, it's okay. really, it's okay.
i hope you two are very happy. i really do.
and, min, you know, if everything works out and you guys end up getting married and having kids and everything i just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.
okay, i know it was a cheap shot, but i feel so much better now.
hi, guys.  hey, phoebe.
hey, oh, how did it go?
um, not so good.
he walked me to the subway and said, "we should do this again."
ouch.
what? he said, "we should do it again."
that's good, right?
uh, no. loosely translated, 
you will never see me naked."
since when?
since always. it's, like, dating language.
you know, like, "it's not you," means, "it is you."
you're such a nice guy," means:
i'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you."
or, you know, um, "i think we should see 
ha, ha, i already am."
and everybody knows this?
oh, yeah. cushions the blow.
like when you're a kid and your parents put your dog to sleep and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
that's funny. no, because, uh, our parents actually did uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
uh, ross?
ha, ha. hello. the milner's farm in connecticut?
the milners, they had this unbelievable farm.
they had horses and rabbits that he could chase.
and it was
oh, my god. chi-chi.
"so how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.
but you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.
hey, that was really good.
yeah?
yeah.
thanks. let's keep going.
okay. "so, what do you want from me, dimon? huh?"
i just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell, i can smoke.
smoke away."
heh.
i think this is probably why dimon smokes in his cell alone.
what?
relax your hand.
let your wrist go.
not so much.
whoa.
hey.
all right. now try taking a puff.
right.
okay, no, give it to me.
no, no, no. i'm not giving you a cigarette.
no, it's fine. it's fine. look, do you want to get this part or not? here.
all right. now, don't think of it as a cigarette.
think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand.
when you're holding it, you feel right.
you feel complete.
you miss it?
no, not so much.
all right. now we smoke.
oh, my god.
no, no, no.
they say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
that's ridiculous.
can i use either thumb?
all right. don't tell me, don't tell me.
decaf cappuccino for joey.
coffee, black.
latte.
and an iced tea.
i'm getting pretty good at this.
excellent. that's very good.
good for me.
you okay, phoebe?
yeah, no, it's not even worth
it's my bank.
what did they do to you?
it's nothing, it's just okay.
i'm going through my mail, and i open up their monthly "statement."
easy.
and there's 500 extra dollars in my account.
oh, satan's minions at work again.
yes, because now i have to go down there and deal with them
what are you talking about? keep it.
it's not mine.
i didn't earn it. if i kept it, it would be like stealing.
yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping.
okay. okay.
let's say i bought a really great pair of shoes.
do you know what i'd hear with every step i took?
not mine. not mine. not mine."
and even if i was happy, okay, and skipping i'd hear, "not mine. not mine."
we're with you. we got it.
okay, i'd never be able to enjoy it. it'd be like this giant karmic debt.
chandler, what are you doing? hey.
what are you doing?
oh, gross.
what is this?
i'm smoking. i'm smoking. i'm smoking.
i can't believe you. you've been so good for three years.
and this is my reward.
hold on a second. just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
okay, so this time i won't quit.
put it out.
all right. i'm putting it out.
oh, no.
i can't drink this now.
all right, i'm gonna go change. i've got a date.
is this alan again? how's it going?
it's going pretty good, you know? it's nice and we're having fun.
so when do we get to meet the guy?  yeah.
let's see, today's monday
never.
come on.
no, not after what happened with steve.
what are you talking about?
look, i don't know how i feel about him yet. give me a chance to figure it out.
well, then can we meet him?
no.
why should i let them meet him?
i bring a guy home and within five minutes they're all over him.
i mean, they're like coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd.
listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef i'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing.
come on, they're your friends. they're looking out after you.
i know, i know. i wish that once i'd bring a guy home they actually liked.
well, you do realize that the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.
let it go, ross.
yeah? well, you didn't know chi-chi.
do you all promise?
yeah, we promise. we'll be good.  we promise.
chandler, do you promise to be good?
you can come in, but your filter tip little buddy has to stay outside.
hey, pheebs.
thank you for calling attention to our error.
we have credited your account $500. we're sorry for the inconvenience and hope you'll accept this football phone as our free gift." do you believe this?
now i have $1000 and a football phone.
what bank is this?
okay, it's him.
who is it?  alan.
chandler. he's here.
okay, please be good. please?
i mean, remember how much you like me.
hi. alan, this is everybody. everybody, this is alan.
hi.  hey.
thanks, i'll call you tomorrow.
okay.
okay, let's let the alan-bashing begin.
who's gonna take the first shot?
hmm?
come on.
i'll go.
let's start with the way he kept picking at
you know, i'm sorry, i can't do this.
can't do it. we loved him.
we loved him.
wait a minute.
we're talking about someone that i'm going out with?
yes.
and did you notice?
yeah.
know what was great? the way his smile was kind of crooked.
yes, yes. like the man in the shoe.
what shoe?
from the nursery rhyme.
there was a crooked man who had a crooked smile who lived in a shoe for a while"
so i think alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
what future boyfriends?
no, no. i think this could be, you know, "it."
really?
oh, yeah.
i'd marry him just for his david hasselhoff impression alone.
you know i'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
you know what i like most about him?
what?
the way he makes me feel about myself.
yeah.
hi.
how was the game?
well
we won!
we won! thank you! yeah.
how is that possible?
alan.
he was unbelievable.
he was like that bugs bunny cartoon where bugs is playing all the positions.
but instead of bugs, it was first base, alan. second base, alan i mean, it was like he made us into a team.
yep. we sure showed those hasidic jewelers a thing or two about softball.
nice.
can i ask you guys a question?
do you ever think that alan is maybe sometimes
what?
i don't know. a little too alan?
oh, no. that's not possible. you can never be too alan.
yeah, it's his innate alan-ness that we adore.
i, personally, could have a gallon of alan.
oh!
hey, lizzy.
hey, weird girl.
i brought you alphabet soup.
did you pick out the vowels?
yes, but i left in the y's. because, you know, "sometimes y."
um, i also have something else for you.
saltines?
no, but would you like $1000 and a football phone?
what?
oh, my god.
oh, my god. there's really money in here.
i know.
weird girl, what are you doing?
oh, i want you to have it. i don't want it.
no, no. i have to give you something.
no, it's fine. you don't
do you want my tinfoil hat?
no, because you need that. no, it's okay. thanks.
please. let me do something.
okay, all right. i'll tell you what.
you buy me a soda and then we're even. okay?
okay.  okay.
keep the change.
thanks, lizzy.
sure you don't want a pretzel?
no, i'm fine. thanks.
see you.
huh.
a thumb?
ew.
i know, i know. i opened it up and there it was just floating in there, like this tiny little hitchhiker.
maybe it's a contest, you know? like "collect all five."
does, um, anyone wanna see?
no, thanks.
oh, hey, don't do that. come on.
cut that out.
it's worse than the thumb.
hey, this is so unfair.
why is it unfair?
so i have a flaw. big deal.
like joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
and ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word.
and monica, with that snort when she laughs.
i mean, what the hell is that thing?
i accept all those flaws. why can't you accept me for this?
does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him?
well i could live without it.
huh.
well, is it, like, a little annoying? or is it like when phoebe chews her hair?
now, don't listen to him, pheebs, all right? i think it's endearing.
oh, you do, do you?
you know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
indeed there isn't.
i should really get back to work.
yeah, otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
oh. the hair comes out and the gloves come off.
did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
no.
okay. well, i'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
we talking about the coyotes here?
heh. all right. a cow got through.
can you believe it?
it's just, you know what?
i just don't feel the thing.
i mean, they feel the thing. i don't feel the thing.
honey, you should always feel the thing.
listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, monica, dump him.
i know, it's just gonna be really hard.
yeah, he's a big boy. he'll get over it.
no, he'll be fine. it's the other five i'm worried about.
do you have any respect for your body?
don't you realize what you're doing to yourself?
hey, you know, i've had it with you and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.
the bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
ahem. chandler?
it's alan. he wants to speak to you.
really? he does?
hey, buddy. what's up?
oh, she told you about that, huh?
well, yeah. i have one now and then. well, yeah, now.
well, it's not that bad
well, that's true.
gee, you know, no one's ever put it like that before.
well, okay. thanks.
god, he's good.
if only he were a woman.
yeah.
oh, lamb chop.
how old is that sock?
if i had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too.
okay, i think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
hey.
where's joey?
joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him.
do you think that was wrong?
i think he's across the hall.
thanks.
