there's nothing to tell. it's just some guy i work with . 
come on. you're going out with a guy . 
there's gotta be something wrong with him . 
so does he have a hump and a hair piece . 
wait. does he eat chalk . 
i don't want her to go through what i went through with carl. oh . 
okay, everybody relax. this is not even a date . 
it's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex . 
sounds like a date to me . 
i'm back in high school, in the middle of the cafeteria and i realize i'm totally naked . 
oh, yeah . 
i've had that dream . 
then i look down and i realize there is a phone there . 
instead o . 
that's right . 
that one, i've never had.  no . 
all of a sudden, the phone starts to ring . 
and it turns out it's my mother . 
which is very, very weird because she never calls me . 
hi . 
this guy says "hello," i wanna kill myself . 
are you okay, sweetie . 
i feel like someone grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck . 
cookie . 
carol moved her stuff out today . 
oh . 
let me get you some coffee . 
thanks . 
ew. unh . 
no. no, don't! stop cleansing my aura . 
just leave my aura alone, okay . 
i'll be fine. all right? really. i hope she'll be very happy . 
no, you don't . 
no, i don't . 
to hell with her. she left me . 
and you never knew she was a lesbian . 
no! okay . 
why does everyone keep fixating on that . 
she didn't know. how should i know . 
sometimes i wish i was a lesbian . 
did i say that out loud . 
all right, ross. look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now . 
you're angry. you're hurting . 
can i tell you what the answer is . 
strip joints . 
come on, you're single. have some hormones . 
see, but i don't want to be single, okay . 
i just wanna be married again . 
and i just want a million dollars . 
rachel . 
oh, god, monica! hi! thank god . 
i went to your building and this guy with a hammer said that you might be here, and you are . 
can i get you some coffee . 
decaf . 
okay, everybody, this is rachel, another lincoln high survivor . 
this is everybody. this is chandler and phoebe and joey. and remember my brother, ross . 
sure . 
hey . 
hi . 
oh, god . 
so you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids . 
oh, god! well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding . 
i was in this room with all the presents and i was looking at this gravy boat . 
this really gorgeous limoges gravy boat . 
when all of a sudden sweet 'n low . 
 i realized i was more turned on by this gravy boat than by barry . 
then i got really freaked out, . 
how much barry looks like mr. potato head . 
you know, i mean, i always knew he looked familiar, but anyway, i just had to get out of there, . 
why am i doing this?" and "who am i doing this for? . 
anyway, i just didn't know where to go, and i know you and i have drifted apart but you're the only person i know in the city . 
who wasn't invited to the wedding . 
oh, i was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue . 
i'm guessing he bought her the big pipe organ and she's really not happy about it . 
daddy, i just i can't marry him . 
i'm sorry . 
i just don't love him . 
well, it matters to me . 
she should not be wearing those pants . 
i say push her down the stairs . 
push her down the stairs! push her down the stairs . 
come on, daddy, listen to me . 
it's like all of my life, everyone's always told me, "you're a shoe . 
you're a shoe! you're a shoe! you're a shoe! . 
then today i stopped and said, "what if i don't wanna be a shoe . 
what if i wanna be a purse? you know . 
or a hat? . 
i don't want you to buy me a hat, i am a hat . 
it's a metaphor, daddy . 
you can see where he'd have trouble . 
look, daddy, it's my life . 
well, maybe i'll just stay here with monica . 
i guess we've established she's staying with monica . 
well, maybe that's my decision . 
well, maybe i don't need your money . 
wait! wait! i said maybe . 
okay. just breathe, that's it . 
just try to think of nice, calm things . 
doorbells and sleigh bells and something with mitten . 
la la la something with strin . 
i'm all better now . 
i helped . 
look, this is probably for the best, you know . 
independence. taking control of your life . 
and, hey, if you need anything, you can always come to joey . 
me and chandler live right across the hall. and he's away a lot . 
joey, stop hitting on her. it's her wedding day . 
what? like there's a rule or something . 
please don't do that again. it's a horrible sound . 
uh, it's paul . 
buzz him in . 
who's paul . 
paul, the wine guy, paul . 
maybe . 
wait a minute. your "not a real date" is with paul, the wine guy . 
he finally asked you out . 
yes . 
ooh. this is a "dear diary" moment . 
rach, wait, i can cancel . 
please, no. go, i'll be fine . 
ross, are you okay? i mean, do you want me to stay . 
that'd be good . 
really . 
no, go on! it's paul, the wine guy . 
hi, come in. paul, this is everybody. everybody, this is paul . 
paul, the wine guy . 
wine guy . 
i didn't catch your name. paul, was it . 
okay. sit down. two seconds . 
okay . 
ooh, i just pulled out four eyelashes. that can't be good . 
so, rachel, what are you up to tonight . 
well, i was supposed to be headed for aruba on my honeymoon so, nothing . 
right. you're not even getting your honeymoon . 
god. no, no. although, aruba. heh. this time of year? eh . 
talk about your big lizards . 
anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight joey and chandler are helping me with my furniture . 
yes, and we're very excited about it . 
actually, thanks, but i'm just gonna hang out here tonight . 
it's been a long day . 
oh, sure. okay. sure . 
hey, pheebs, you wanna help . 
oh, i wish i could, but i don't want to . 
i'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things using a bunch of these little worm guys . 
i have no bracket-y thing, i see no worm guys whatsoever and i cannot feel my legs . 
what's this . 
i have no idea . 
done with the bookcase . 
all finished . 
this was carol's favorite beer . 
she always drank it out of the can. i should have known . 
hey. ross, let me ask you a question . 
she got the furniture, the stereo, the good tv . 
what did you get . 
you guys . 
oh, god. oh, my god . 
you got screwed . 
oh, my god . 
i know, i know. i'm such an idiot . 
i should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week . 
i mean, how clean can teeth get . 
my brother's going through that. he's such a mess . 
how did you get through it . 
he might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers . 
say he . 
leg . 
heh. that's one way of going through it, yeah . 
me, i went for the watch . 
you actually broke her watch . 
mm . 
barry, i'm sorry. i am so sorry . 
you probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't . 
it isn't, it's about me. and i hi. machine cut me off again. anyway you know what's scary? what if there's only one woman for everybody . 
i mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it . 
unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her . 
what are you talking about? one woman . 
that's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you . 
let me tell you something, ross. there's lots of flavors out there . 
there's rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla . 
you can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream . 
this is the best thing that ever happened to you . 
you got married. you were like, what, 8 . 
welcome back to the world. grab a spoon . 
i honestly don't know if i'm hungry or horny . 
then stay out of my freezer . 
ever since she walked out on me,  . 
what? what . 
you wanna spell it out with noodles . 
no, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation . 
oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date . 
isn't there . 
yeah, yeah. i think there is . 
what were you gonna say . 
well er, uh ever since she left me, um i haven't been able to perform sexually . 
oh, god! oh, god! i am s . 
i'm so sorry . 
it's okay . 
being spit on is probably not what you need right now . 
u . 
how long . 
two years . 
wow . 
i'm glad you smashed her watch . 
so you still think you might want that fifth date . 
yeah . 
yeah, i do . 
i, joanie, take you, charles, as my lawful husband . 
do you take joanie . 
oh! see . 
but joanie loved chachi. that's the difference . 
grab a spoon. . 
do you know long it's been since i grabbed a spoon . 
do the words, "billy, don't be a hero," mean anything to you . 
you know, here's the thing. even if i could get it together enough to ask a woman out who am i gonna ask . 
isn't this amazing . 
i mean, i have never made coffee before in my life . 
that is amazing . 
congratulations . 
while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make a western omelet or something although, actually i'm really not that hungry this morning . 
good morning.  good morning . 
morning.  morning . 
morning.  morning, paul . 
hello, paul . 
hi. paul, is it . 
i had a really great time last night . 
thank you. thank you so much .

thank you . 
that wasn't a real date . 
what the hell do you do on a real date . 
shut up and put my table back.  okay . 
all right, kids, i gotta get to work . 
if i don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference . 
so, like, you guys all have jobs . 
yeah, we all have jobs . 
see, that's how we buy stuff . 
yeah, i'm an actor . 
wow. would i have seen you in anything . 
oh, i doubt it. mostly regional work . 
unless you happened to catch the wee one's production of pinocchio . 
look, geppeto. i'm a real live boy. . 
i will not take this abuse . 
you're right. i'm sorry . 
so how are you doing today? did you sleep okay . 
did you talk to barry? i can't stop smiling . 
i can see that. you look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth . 
i know. he's just s . 
remember you and tony de marco . 
oh, yeah . 
well, it's like that. with feelings . 
oh, wow, are you in trouble . 
okay, okay. i am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day . 
or else i'm just gonna get up and go to work . 
oh, wish me luck . 
what for . 
i'm gonna go get one of those job things . 
hey, monica . 
hey, franny. welcome back . 
how was florida . 
you had sex, didn't you . 
how do you do that . 
so, who . 
you know paul . 
paul, the wine guy . 
oh, yeah, i know paul . 
you mean, you know paul like i know paul . 
are you kidding? i take credit for paul . 
before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years . 
of course it was a line . 
why? why would anybody do something like that . 
we're looking for an answer . 
to get you into bed. . 
is it me . 
is it like i have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear . 
all right, come here. give me your feet . 
i just thought he was nice, you know . 
i can't believe you didn't know it was a line . 
guess what . 
you got a job . 
are you kidding . 
i'm trained for nothing . 
i was laughed out of 12 interviews today . 
yet you're surprisingly upbeat . 
well, you would be too if you found joan and david boots on sale 50 percent off . 
oh, how well you know me . 
they're my new "i don't need a job or my parents . 
i've got great boots" boots . 
how'd you pay for them . 
uh, credit card . 
and who pays for that . 
um, my father . 
you can't live off your parents your whole life . 
i know that. that's why i was getting married . 
give her a break. it's hard being on your own for the first time . 
thank you . 
you're welcome . 
i remember when i first came to this city, i was 14 . 
my mom had killed herself and my stepdad was back in prison . 
and i got here, and i didn't know anybody . 
i ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields outside port authority. and then he killed himself . 
and then i found aromatherapy. so believe me, i know exactly how you feel . 
the word you're looking for is . 
anyway . 
all right. you ready . 
i don't think so.  oh, come on . 
cut. cut . 
cut, cut, cut . 
hey.  all right . 
welcome to the real world . 
it sucks. you're gonna love it . 
well, that's it. you gonna crash on the couch . 
no. no, i gotta go home sometime . 
are you gonna be okay . 
yeah . 
look what i just found on the floor . 
what . 
that's paul's watch . 
you can just put it back where you found it . 
oh, boy. all right. good night, everybody . 
good night . 
hmm . 
hmm . 
oh, sorry . 
no. oh, no. go . 
no, have it, really . 
split it . 
okay . 
okay . 
thanks . 
you probably didn't know this, but back in high school i had a major crush on you . 
i knew . 
you did? oh . 
i figured you thought i was monica's geeky older brother . 
i did . 
oh . 
listen, do you think and try not to let my vulnerability become any kind of a factor here . 
do you think it would be okay if i ask you out sometime, maybe . 
yeah . 
maybe . 
okay . 
okay, maybe i will . 
good night . 
good night . 
see you . 
mm-hm . 
wait, wait. hey, what's with you . 
i just grabbed a spoon . 
can't believe what i'm hearing . 
what? i said you ha . 
what? i said you ha . 
would you stop . 
oh, was i doing it again . 
yes . 
would anybody like more coffee . 
did you make it or are you just serving it . 
i'm just serving it.  i'll have a cup of coffee . 
kids, new dream . 
i'm in las vegas. i'm liza minnelli . 
what you guys don't understand is for us, kissing is as important as any part of it . 
yeah, right . 
you serious . 
oh, yeah . 
everything you need to know is in that first kiss . 
absolutely . 
yeah, i think, for us kissing is pretty much like an opening act . 
i mean, it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out . 
yeah, and it's not that we don't like the comedian . 
it's just that that's not why we bought the ticket . 
see, the problem is, though after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was you girls are always looking for the comedian again . 
i mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic basically just trying to stay awake . 
bring back the comedian . 
otherwise, you're gonna find yourself sitting at home listening to that album alone . 
are we still talking about sex . 
no, it's good. it is good . 
it's just that, doesn't she seem a little angry . 
well, she has issues . 
does she . 
he's out banging other women over the head with a club while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet . 
marsha, see, these are cave people . 
okay, they have issues like . 
gee, that glacier's getting kind of close." see . 
speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife . 
no, no . 
yes, it is. carol, hi . 
okay. yes. yes, it is . 
how about i'll catch up with you in the ice age . 
hi . 
hi . 
s . 
you look great . 
i hate that . 
sorry. thanks. you look good too . 
well, you know, in here, anyone who stands erec . 
so, what's new? still  . 
a lesbian . 
wel . 
you never know . 
how's, um? how's the family . 
marty's still totally paranoid . 
oh, an . 
carol, why are you here, carol . 
i'm pregnant . 
pregnant . 
oh. looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all . 
i think this is the episode of three's company where's there's some kind of misunderstanding . 
then i've already seen this one . 
are you through with that? thanks . 
yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down . 
whose little ball of paper is this . 
oh, that would be mine . 
see, i wrote a note to myself, then i didn't need it . 
so i balled it up and now i wish i was dead . 
she already fluffed that pillow. monica, you know, you already fluffe . 
but it's fine . 
look, i'm sorry . 
i don't want to give them any more ammunition than they have . 
yes, we know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow . 
monica? hi. u . 
monica, um, you're scaring me . 
i mean, you're, like, all chaotic and twirly, you know . 
not in a good way . 
yeah, calm down . 
you don't see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come . 
that's because, as far as my parents are concerned, ross can do no wrong . 
you see, he's the prince . 
apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born . 
ew, ew, ew . 
what . 
ugly naked guy got a thighmaster . 
ew . 
has anybody seen my engagement ring . 
yeah, it's beautiful . 
oh, god. oh, god . 
oh, god, oh, god, oh, god . 
no, don't touch that . 
oh, like i wasn't dreading tomorrow enough having to give it back to him . 
hi, barry, remember me? i'm the girl that stomped on your heart in front of your entire family . 
oh, god. now i'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring which makes it so much harder . 
easy, rach, we'll find it. won't we . 
oh, yeah.  okay, look . 
when did you have it on last . 
doy. probably right before she lost it . 
you don't get a lot of "doy" these days . 
i know i had it this morning . 
i know i had it when i was in the kitchen wit . 
dinah . 
oh, don't be mad . 
you didn't . 
oh, i'm sorry . 
i gave you one job . 
oh, but look how straight those noodles are . 
monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna . 
i just can't do it . 
boys . 
we're going in . 
hi . 
oh, that is not a happy "hi. . 
carol's pregnant . 
oh, i found it . 
well, what? what . 
yeah . 
do that for another two hours you might be where i am right about now . 
kind of puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, mon . 
well, now, how do you fit into this whole thing . 
well, carol says she and susan want me to be involved . 
but if i'm not comfortable with it, i don't have to be involved . 
basically, it's totally up to me . 
she is so great. i miss her . 
what does she mean by "involved" . 
i mean, presumably, the biggest part of your job is done . 
anyway, they want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow . 
so, what are you gonna do . 
i have no idea . 
no matter what i do, though, i'm still gonna be a father . 
well, this is still ruined, right . 
oh. martha lugwin's daughter is gonna call you . 
mm. what's that curry taste . 
curry . 
mm . 
i think they're great. i really do . 
you remember the lugwins . 
the big one had a thing for you, didn't she . 
they all had a thing for him . 
oh, mom . 
i'm sorry. why is this girl going to call me . 
oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking or food or i don't know . 
anyway, i told her you had a restaurant, so no, mom. i don't have a restaurant. i work in a restaurant . 
well, they don't have to know that . 
ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti . 
yes . 
oh, we're having spaghetti. that's easy . 
i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish on my part but were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing . 
because i think it might take some of the heat off me . 
what that rachel did to her life. we ran into her parents at the club . 
they were not playing very well . 
i'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding but $40,000 is a lot of money . 
well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar . 
what's that supposed to mean . 
nothing . 
it's an expression . 
no, it's not . 
don't listen to your mother . 
you're independent and you always have been . 
even when you were a kid, and you were chubby and you had no friends, you were just fine . 
you'd read alone in your room. and your puzzles look, there are people, like ross, who need to shoot for the stars . 
with his museum and his papers getting published . 
other people are satisfied with staying where they are . 
i'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer . 
and i read about these women trying to have it all, and i thank god our little harmonica doesn't seem to have that problem . 
so, ross, what's going on with you . 
any stories? no news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks . 
okay, okay . 
ahem. look, i, uh i realize you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me . 
and so, well, here's the deal . 
carol's a lesbian . 
she's living with a woman named susan . 
she's pregnant with my child . 
and she and susan are going to raise the baby . 
and you knew about this . 
your folks are really that bad, huh . 
well, you know, these people are pros . 
they know what they're doing. they take their time . 
they get the job done . 
boy, i know they say that you can't change your parents . 
boy, if you could, i'd want yours . 
must pee . 
you know, it's even worse when you're twins . 
you're a twin . 
oh, yeah. we don't speak . 
she's like this high-powered, driven, career-type . 
what does she do . 
she's a waitress . 
all right. you guys, i kind of gotta clean up now . 
chandler, you're an only child, right? you don't have any of this . 
well, no, although i did have an imaginary friend who my parents actually preferred . 
hit the lights, please . 
how long was i in there . 
i'm just cleaning up . 
oh, do you, uh? do you need any help . 
um, okay, sure. thanks . 
anywa . 
so you nervous about barry tomorrow . 
oh, a little . 
mm-hm . 
a lot . 
mm-hm . 
so got any advice . 
you know, as someone who's recently been dumped . 
well, you may want to steer clear of the word "dumped. . 
chances are he's going to be this broken shell of a man. you know . 
so you should try not to look too terrific. i know it'll be hard . 
or, you know, hey, i'll go down there, and i'll give barry back his ring . 
and you can go with carol and susan to the ob-gyn . 
you've got carol tomorrow . 
when did it get so complicated . 
got me . 
remember when we were in high school . 
yeah . 
i mean, didn't you think you' were gonna meet someone fall in love, and that'd be it . 
ross . 
yes, yes . 
oh. man. i never thought i'd be here . 
me neither . 
hi. sorry i'm late. i got stuck at work . 
there was this big dinosaur thing. anywa . 
hi . 
ross, you remember susan . 
how could i forget . 
ross . 
hello, susan. good shake, good shake . 
so, uh, we're just waiting for . 
dr. oberman . 
dr. oberman. okay, and is he . 
she . 
of course, "she. . 
she, uh, familiar with our special situation . 
yes, and she's very supportive . 
great. okay, that's great. heh . 
no, i'm  thanks . 
quack, quack quack, quack, quack . 
ross . 
that opens my cervix . 
barry?  come on in . 
are you sure . 
it's fine, it's fine. robbie's gonna be here for hours . 
huh . 
so how are you doing . 
i' . 
i'm okay . 
you look great . 
yeah, well  dr. farber, jason greenspan's gagging . 
be right there. i'll be back in a second . 
i dumped him . 
okay . 
oh . 
ross . 
so, um? so how's this going to work ahem, you know, with us . 
you know, when, like, important decisions have to be made . 
give me a "for instance. . 
well, i don't know. okay, okay . 
how about with the baby's name . 
marlo . 
marlon. if it's a boy. minnie, if it's a girl . 
as in "mouse" . 
as in my grandmother . 
still, you say "minnie," you hear "mouse. . 
how about, u . 
how about "julia" . 
julia . 
we agreed on minnie . 
it's funny, um, we agreed we'd spend our lives together . 
things change. roll with the punches . 
i believe julia's on the table . 
oh. sorry about that . 
so, what have you been up to . 
oh. not much . 
i got a job . 
hey, that's great . 
why are you so tan . 
oh, i, u .

yeah, well, we're kind of a thing now . 
well, i' .

and you got lenses . 
but you hate sticking your finger in your eye . 
not for her . 
oh .

what, it's gonna be helen willick . 
no, actually, um, we talked about helen willick bunch . 
well, wait a minute. why is she in the title . 
because it's my baby too .

uh-huh. see . 
all right, you two, stop it . 
no, no. she gets a credit. hey, i'm in there too .

i think that borders on child abuse . 
of course not. i'm suggesting geller willick bunch . 
oh, no. no, no, no. you see what he's doing . 
he knows no one is gonna say all those names . 
he knows they'll wind up calling her geller. then he gets his way . 
my way? you think this is my way . 
believe me, of all the ways i ever imagined this moment in my life being this is not my way. you know what? this is too hard . 
knock, knock. how are we today? any nausea . 
a little . 
just a little . 
well, i was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but, uh, thanks for sharing . 
uh, lie back . 
you know what? i'm gonna go . 
um, i don't think i can be involved in this particular family thing . 
oh, my god . 
look at that . 
i know . 
well, isn't that amazing . 
what are we supposed to be seeing here . 
i don't know, but i think it's about to attack the enterprise . 
you know, if you tilt your head to the left and relax your eyes it kind of looks like an old potato . 
then don't do that, all right . 
monica .

and, min, you know, if everything works out and you guys end up getting married and having kids and everything i just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose . 
okay, i know it was a cheap shot, but i feel so much better now . 
hi, guys.  hey, phoebe . 
hey, oh, how did it go . 
um, not so good . 
he walked me to the subway and said, "we should do this again. . 
ouch . 
what? he said, "we should do it again. . 
that's good, right . 
uh, no. loosely translated, . 
you will never see me naked. . 
since when . 
since always. it's, like, dating language . 
you know, like, "it's not you," means, "it is you. . 
you're such a nice guy," means . 
i'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you. . 
or, you know, um, "i think we should see . 
ha, ha, i already am. . 
and everybody knows this . 
oh, yeah. cushions the blow . 
like when you're a kid and your parents put your dog to sleep and they tell you it went off to live on some farm . 
that's funny. no, because, uh, our parents actually did uh, send our dog off to live on a farm . 
uh, ross . 
ha, ha. hello. the milner's farm in connecticut . 
the milners, they had this unbelievable farm . 
they had horses and rabbits that he could chase . 
and it wa . 
oh, my god. chi-chi . 
"so how does it feel knowing you're about to die? . 
warden, in five minutes my pain will be over . 
but you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die . 
hey, that was really good . 
yeah . 
yeah . 
thanks. let's keep going . 
okay. "so, what do you want from me, dimon? huh? . 
i just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell, i can smoke . 
smoke away. . 
heh . 
i think this is probably why dimon smokes in his cell alone . 
what . 
relax your hand . 
let your wrist go . 
not so much . 
whoa . 
hey . 
all right. now try taking a puff . 
right . 
okay, no, give it to me . 
no, no, no. i'm not giving you a cigarette . 
no, it's fine. it's fine. look, do you want to get this part or not? here . 
all right. now, don't think of it as a cigarette . 
think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand . 
when you're holding it, you feel right . 
you feel complete . 
you miss it . 
no, not so much . 
all right. now we smoke . 
oh, my god . 
no, no, no . 
they say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger . 
that's ridiculous . 
can i use either thumb . 
all right. don't tell me, don't tell me . 
decaf cappuccino for joey . 
coffee, black . 
latte . 
and an iced tea . 
i'm getting pretty good at this . 
excellent. that's very good . 
good for me . 
you okay, phoebe . 
yeah, no, it's not even wort . 
it's my bank . 
what did they do to you . 
it's nothing, it's just okay . 
i'm going through my mail, and i open up their monthly "statement. . 
easy . 
and there's 500 extra dollars in my account . 
oh, satan's minions at work again . 
yes, because now i have to go down there and deal with the . 
what are you talking about? keep it . 
it's not mine . 
i didn't earn it. if i kept it, it would be like stealing . 
yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping . 
okay. okay . 
let's say i bought a really great pair of shoes . 
do you know what i'd hear with every step i took . 
not mine. not mine. not mine. . 
and even if i was happy, okay, and skipping i'd hear, "not mine. not mine. . 
we're with you. we got it . 
okay, i'd never be able to enjoy it. it'd be like this giant karmic debt . 
chandler, what are you doing? hey . 
what are you doing . 
oh, gross . 
what is this . 
i'm smoking. i'm smoking. i'm smoking . 
i can't believe you. you've been so good for three years . 
and this is my reward . 
hold on a second. just think about what you went through the last time you quit . 
okay, so this time i won't quit . 
put it out . 
all right. i'm putting it out . 
oh, no . 
i can't drink this now . 
all right, i'm gonna go change. i've got a date . 
is this alan again? how's it going . 
it's going pretty good, you know? it's nice and we're having fun . 
so when do we get to meet the guy?  yeah . 
let's see, today's monda . 
never . 
come on . 
no, not after what happened with steve . 
what are you talking about . 
look, i don't know how i feel about him yet. give me a chance to figure it out . 
well, then can we meet him . 
no . 
why should i let them meet him . 
i bring a guy home and within five minutes they're all over him . 
i mean, they're like coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd . 
listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef i'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing . 
come on, they're your friends. they're looking out after you . 
i know, i know. i wish that once i'd bring a guy home they actually liked . 
well, you do realize that the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy . 
let it go, ross . 
yeah? well, you didn't know chi-chi . 
do you all promise . 
yeah, we promise. we'll be good.  we promise . 
chandler, do you promise to be good . 
you can come in, but your filter tip little buddy has to stay outside . 
hey, pheebs . 
thank you for calling attention to our error . 
we have credited your account $500. we're sorry for the inconvenience and hope you'll accept this football phone as our free gift." do you believe this . 
now i have $1000 and a football phone . 
what bank is this . 
okay, it's him . 
who is it?  alan . 
chandler. he's here . 
okay, please be good. please . 
i mean, remember how much you like me . 
hi. alan, this is everybody. everybody, this is alan . 
hi.  hey . 
thanks, i'll call you tomorrow . 
okay . 
okay, let's let the alan-bashing begin . 
who's gonna take the first shot . 
hmm . 
come on . 
i'll go . 
let's start with the way he kept picking a . 
you know, i'm sorry, i can't do this . 
can't do it. we loved him . 
we loved him . 
wait a minute . 
we're talking about someone that i'm going out with . 
yes . 
and did you notice . 
yeah . 
know what was great? the way his smile was kind of crooked . 
yes, yes. like the man in the shoe . 
what shoe . 
from the nursery rhyme . 
there was a crooked man who had a crooked smile who lived in a shoe for a while . 
so i think alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured . 
what future boyfriends . 
no, no. i think this could be, you know, "it. . 
really . 
oh, yeah . 
i'd marry him just for his david hasselhoff impression alone . 
you know i'm gonna be doing that at parties, right . 
you know what i like most about him . 
what . 
the way he makes me feel about myself . 
yeah . 
hi . 
how was the game . 
wel . 
we won . 
we won! thank you! yeah . 
how is that possible . 
alan . 
he was unbelievable . 
he was like that bugs bunny cartoon where bugs is playing all the positions . 
but instead of bugs, it was first base, alan. second base, alan i mean, it was like he made us into a team . 
yep. we sure showed those hasidic jewelers a thing or two about softball . 
nice . 
can i ask you guys a question . 
do you ever think that alan is maybe sometime . 
what . 
i don't know. a little too alan . 
oh, no. that's not possible. you can never be too alan . 
yeah, it's his innate alan-ness that we adore . 
i, personally, could have a gallon of alan . 
oh . 
hey, lizzy . 
hey, weird girl . 
i brought you alphabet soup . 
did you pick out the vowels . 
yes, but i left in the y's. because, you know, "sometimes y. . 
um, i also have something else for you . 
saltines . 
no, but would you like $1000 and a football phone . 
what . 
oh, my god . 
oh, my god. there's really money in here . 
i know . 
weird girl, what are you doing . 
oh, i want you to have it. i don't want it . 
no, no. i have to give you something . 
no, it's fine. you don' . 
do you want my tinfoil hat . 
no, because you need that. no, it's okay. thanks . 
please. let me do something . 
okay, all right. i'll tell you what . 
you buy me a soda and then we're even. okay . 
okay.  okay . 
keep the change . 
thanks, lizzy . 
sure you don't want a pretzel . 
no, i'm fine. thanks . 
see you . 
huh . 
a thumb . 
ew . 
i know, i know. i opened it up and there it was just floating in there, like this tiny little hitchhiker . 
maybe it's a contest, you know? like "collect all five. . 
does, um, anyone wanna see . 
no, thanks . 
oh, hey, don't do that. come on . 
cut that out . 
it's worse than the thumb . 
hey, this is so unfair . 
why is it unfair . 
so i have a flaw. big deal . 
like joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying . 
and ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word . 
and monica, with that snort when she laughs . 
i mean, what the hell is that thing . 
i accept all those flaws. why can't you accept me for this . 
does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him . 
well i could live without it . 
huh . 
well, is it, like, a little annoying? or is it like when phoebe chews her hair . 
now, don't listen to him, pheebs, all right? i think it's endearing . 
oh, you do, do you . 
you know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly . 
indeed there isn't . 
i should really get back to work . 
yeah, otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered . 
oh. the hair comes out and the gloves come off . 
did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like . 
no . 
okay. well, i'm going out with a guy my friends all really like . 
we talking about the coyotes here . 
heh. all right. a cow got through . 
can you believe it . 
it's just, you know what . 
i just don't feel the thing . 
i mean, they feel the thing. i don't feel the thing . 
honey, you should always feel the thing . 
listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, monica, dump him . 
i know, it's just gonna be really hard . 
yeah, he's a big boy. he'll get over it . 
no, he'll be fine. it's the other five i'm worried about . 
do you have any respect for your body . 
don't you realize what you're doing to yourself . 
hey, you know, i've had it with you and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease . 
the bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it . 
ahem. chandler . 
it's alan. he wants to speak to you . 
really? he does . 
hey, buddy. what's up . 
oh, she told you about that, huh . 
well, yeah. i have one now and then. well, yeah, now . 
well, it's not that ba . 
well, that's true . 
gee, you know, no one's ever put it like that before . 
well, okay. thanks . 
god, he's good . 
if only he were a woman . 
yeah . 
oh, lamb chop . 
how old is that sock . 
if i had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too . 
okay, i think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch . 
hey . 
where's joey . 
joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him . 
do you think that was wrong . 
i think he's across the hall . 
thanks . 
there you go . 
ooh, i'm alive with pleasure now . 
hey, pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that pop tart . 
does anyone want the rest of this pop tart . 
hey, i might . 
i'm sorry . 
you know, those stupid soda people gave me $7000 for the thumb . 
oh, my god . 
seven thousand dollars . 
and on my way over here, i stepped in gum . 
what is up with the universe . 
what's going on . 
nothing. i just think it's nice when we're all here together . 
it's even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear . 
uh, joe . 
oh . 
okay . 
oh, come on . 
please, guys, we have to talk . 
wait, wait. i'm getting a déjà vu . 
no, i'm not . 
all right, we have to talk . 
there it is . 
okay, it's about alan . 
there's something you should know . 
oh, man, there's really no easy way to say this. u . 
i've decided to break up with alan . 
is there somebody else . 
no, no, no. it's just you know, things change. people change . 
we didn't change . 
so that's it? it's over . 
just like that . 
you know, you let your guard down . 
you know, you start to really care about someone, and i jus . 
look, i could go on pretendin . 
okay . 
no. no, that wouldn't be fair to me it wouldn't be fair to alan, or to you . 
yeah, well, who wants fair . 
i mean, i just want things back, you know, the way they were . 
i'm sorry . 
oh, she's sorry. i feel better . 
i just can't believe this . 
i mean, with the holidays coming up. i wanted him to meet my family . 
i'll meet someone else. there'll be other alans . 
yeah, right . 
are you guys gonna be okay . 
hey, hey. we'll be fine . 
we're just gonna need a little time . 
i understand . 
wow . 
i'm really sorry . 
yeah. i mean, i'm sorry too . 
but i gotta tell you, i'm a little relieved . 
relieved . 
yeah, well i mean, i had a great time with you . 
i just can't stand your friends . 
remember when we went to central park and rented boats . 
that was fun . 
yeah. he could row like a viking .

i mean, that guy with the toe thing? who's he sleeping with . 
oh, come on, dora. don't be mad . 
i know we both said some things we didn't mean but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other . 
you know, i feel like i've lost her . 
lights still out . 
yeah . 
well, maybe they're napping . 
heh. please. they're having sex . 
shut up . 
so, what do you think george is like . 
i think he's shy . 
oh, yeah . 
yeah. i think you have to draw him out . 
and then when you do, he's a preppy animal . 
come on . 
i remember the moonlight coming in through the open window and her face had the most incredible glow . 
yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling . 
you did this part . 
could i get some painkillers over here, please . 
he's right, enough already. what is the big deal about today . 
so you slept with her for the first time. so what . 
you slept with her for seven years after that . 
it's just a little more complicated than that . 
what? what is it? that she left you? that she likes women . 
that she left you for a woman that likes women . 
a little louder . 
there's a man on the 12th floor in a coma who didn't quite hear you . 
then what . 
my first time with carol was was m . 
what . 
it was my first time . 
with carol . 
oh . 
so in your whole life, you've only been with one . 
oh . 
oh, boy. hockey was a big mistake . 
there's a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight . 
okay. okay, i got one . 
do you remember that vegetarian pâté that i made that you loved so much . 
uh-huh . 
well, unless goose is a vegetabl . 
oh! oh!  ha-ha-ha . 
okay, fine, fine . 
now i don't feel so bad about sleeping with jason hurley . 
what? you slept with jason . 
you had already broken up . 
how long . 
just a couple hours . 
oh, that's nice . 
okay, okay, okay, i got one . 
anyway . 
the valentine tommy rollerson left in your locker was really from me . 
excuse me . 
oh, hello? like he was really gonna send you one . 
she was a big girl . 
really . 
well, at least big girls don't pee in their pants in seventh grade . 
i was laughing. you made me laugh . 
oh, my god. there he is. there he is. there he is . 
where . 
right where we've been looking all night . 
oh, he's so cute . 
oh, george, baby, drop the towel . 
come on, drop the towel.  drop the towel . 
please drop the towel. drop it . 
wow . 
man, can you believe he's only had sex with one woman . 
i think it's great . 
you know, it's sweet. it's romantic . 
really . 
no, are you kidding? the guy's a freak. i judge him . 
hey, man . 
hey, buddy . 
ah? ah . 
oh . 
that's attractive . 
oh, i thought you were great in silence of the lambs . 
oh, come on, admit it, all things considered, you had fun tonight . 
fun? where was the fun . 
tell me specifically, which part was the fun part . 
where's my puck . 
oh. the kid has it . 
the kid . 
ahem. excuse me, uh, that's my puck . 
i found it. finders keepers, losers weepers . 
you gotta do it, man . 
oh, yeah? well, i'm rubber, you're glue. whatever yo . 
i can't do it . 
listen, uh, give me back my puck . 
no . 
yes, how about . 
no . 
no, come here. just give me my puck . 
no, no, no . 
hey, no roughhousing in my er . 
give me my puck! unh . 
now, that was fun . 
okay, monica . 
right foot, red . 
could've played monopoly, but no . 
thanks . 
okay, pheebs. right hand, blue . 
good.  hmm . 
hello . 
oh. rachel, it's the visa-card people.  oh, okay. will you take my place . 
all right. yes, this is rachel . 
no . 
oh . 
hello . 
oh, yeah. no, i know. i haven't been using it much . 
oh, well, thanks, but i'm okay, really . 
to the green, to the green . 
oh, no . 
to the green . 
i've got magic beans . 
no, no, never mind . 
to the left. to the left . 
i'm fine . 
would you let it go? it's not a big deal . 
not a big deal? it's amazing . 
you just reach in, there's one little maneuver, and bam . 
a bra. right out the sleeve . 
as far as i'm concerned there is nothing a guy can do that comes close. right . 
come on! you guys can pee standing up . 
we can? okay, i'm trying that . 
you know what blows my mind . 
women can see breasts anytime they want . 
you just look down, and there they are . 
how you get any work done is beyond me . 
what i don't get is the way guys can do so many mean things and then not even care . 
multiple orgasms . 
so saturday night, the big night . 
date night! saturday night. saturday night . 
no plans, huh . 
not a one . 
not even, say, breaking up with janice . 
oh, right, right. shut up . 
chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone . 
you just gotta do it . 
i know. but it's just so hard . 
you're sitting with her. she has no idea what's happening . 
you finally get up the courage to do it . 
there's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note . 
why do you have to break up with her . 
be a man. just stop calling . 
if you want, i'll do it with you . 
thanks, but she'd feel like we were ganging up on her . 
i mean you break up with janice. i'll break up with tony . 
you're breaking up with tony . 
i know. he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore . 
i don't know if it's me or his hunger strike. i don't know . 
does anybody want anything else . 
yeah. last week you had a wonderful nutty, chocolate-y, kind of cake-y pie thing tha . 
nothing. i'm fine . 
what's the matter? why so scrunchie . 
it's my father. he wants to give me a mercedes convertible . 
that guy, he burns me up . 
yeah, well, it's a mercedes if i move back home . 
it was horrible! he called me "young lady. . 
ooh, i hate when my father calls me that . 
did he give you that whole "you're not up to this" thing again . 
yeah, i got the extended disco . 
you'll never make it on your own. . 
hi, joey . 
oh, my god. angela . 
wow. being dumped by you obviously agrees with her . 
are you gonna go over there . 
no . 
yeah. no . 
okay, but not yet. i don't wanna seem too eager . 
one mississippi, two mississippi three mississippi. that seems pretty cool . 
hey, angela . 
joey . 
you look good . 
because i'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs . 
you don't say . 
so, rachel, what are you doing tonight . 
big glamour night. me and monica at launderama . 
oh . 
you wanna hear a freakish coincidence . 
guess who's doing laundry there too . 
who . 
me . 
was that not clear . 
hey, why don't . 
why don't i just join you both there . 
don't you have a laundry room in your building . 
yes . 
i do have a laundry room in my building . 
um but there's a rat problem . 
apparently, they're attracted to the dryer sheets . 
they're going in fine, but they're coming out all fluffy . 
anyway, 7-ish . 
sure . 
forget it, joey. i'm with bob now . 
bob? who the hell's bob . 
bob is great . 
he's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job . 
you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor. but bo . 
come on. we were great together . 
and not just at the fun stuff, but, like, talking too . 
sorry, joey. you said, "let's just be friends. . 
so guess what . 
what . 
we're just friends . 
fine. fine . 
so why don't the four of us go out and have dinner tonight? you know, as friends . 
what "four of us" . 
you and bob, and me and my girlfriend, um monica . 
monica, i'm telling you, this guy is perfect for you . 
forget it! not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet . 
come on, this guy's great. his name's bob. he's angela's ahem, brother . 
he's smart, he's sophisticated and he has a real job . 
me, i go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but bob i . 
oh, god, help us . 
what . 
ugly naked guy is laying kitchen tile . 
ew . 
look, i'm asking a favor here . 
i'm thinking if i do this for her brother maybe angela will come back to me . 
what's going on here? you go out with tons of girls . 
i know, but look, i made a huge mistake. i never should've broke up with her . 
will you help me? please . 
okay. bye . 
monica's not coming. it's just gonna be me and rachel . 
hold on there, camper. you sure you've thought this through . 
it's laundry. the thinking through is pretty minimal . 
it's just you and rachel? just the two of you . 
this is a date. you're going on a date . 
nuh-uh . 
yeah-huh . 
what are you saying . 
i should shave again? pick up some wine? what . 
well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear . 
it's the first time she'll see your underwear. you want it to be dirty . 
no . 
and the fabric softener . 
okay, okay. now, what is wrong with my snuggles . 
what? it says i'm a sensitive, warm kind of guy . 
you know, like a little fuzzy bear . 
i can pick something else up on the way . 
thank you . 
so what does this bob guy look like? is he tall, short . 
yep . 
which . 
which what . 
you've never met bob, have you . 
no, but for all we know, he could be horribly horribly attractive. i'll be shutting up now . 
where are they? where are they . 
this is nice. we never do anything, just the two of us . 
that's great. maybe tomorrow we can rent a car, run over some puppies . 
ew. i don't wanna do that . 
here we go . 
have a good breakup . 
hey, janice . 
my god, i am so glad you called me . 
i had the most supremely awful day . 
that's not good . 
can i get an espresso and a latte over here, please . 
we got the proofs from that photo shoot with the vegetables . 
they sucked . 
i blew off the rest of the afternoon. i went shopping . 
and i got you  i'm looking. i'm looking . 
i'm looking . 
i got yo . 
what . 
what . 
what did you get me there . 
i got you these . 
bullwinkle socks . 
that's so sweet . 
i knew you had the rockys . 
so you could wear bullwinkle and bullwinkle or wear rocky and rocky, or you can mix and match . 
moose and squirrel . 
whatever you want . 
i'm gonna get another espresso. more latte . 
no . 
no, i'm still working on mine . 
that's it . 
yeah, it was really hard . 
yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal . 
okay, you weren't there . 
coming through! move! move . 
excuse me! i was kind of using that machine . 
yeah, well, now you're kind of not . 
but i saved it. i put my basket on top . 
i'm sorry. is that your basket . 
yes . 
it's really pretty. unfortunately, i don't see suds . 
what . 
no suds, no save, okay . 
what's going on . 
hi . 
nothing. this horrible woman just took my machine . 
was your basket on top . 
yeah, but there were no suds . 
so . 
you know, no suds, no save . 
no suds, no excuse me . 
hold on a second . 
this is my friend's machine . 
hey, hey, hey! her stuff wasn't in it . 
hey, hey, hey! that's not the rule, and you know it . 
all right. show's over . 
nothing to see here . 
okay. let's do laundry . 
that was amazing! i can't even send back soup . 
well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentl . 
do you, uh . 
oh, hey. you must need detergent . 
what's that . 
berweiss . 
it's new. it's german. it's extra tough . 
rach, do you? are you gonna separate those . 
oh, god. ugh . 
am i being like a total laundry spaz . 
am i supposed to use one machine for shirts and another for pants . 
have you? have you never done this before . 
well, not myself. but i know other people that have . 
okay. you caught me. i'm a laundry virgin . 
don't worry. i'll use the gentle cycle . 
okay basically, you wanna use one machine for all your whites . 
whites. okay . 
a whole other machine for your colors . 
colors . 
and then a third for your, uh delicates. and that would be your bras and your underpanty things . 
okay, well, these are white cotton panties . 
would they go with whites or with delicates . 
that would be a judgment call . 
he's so cute . 
so where did you guys grow up . 
brooklyn heights . 
cleveland . 
ha. heh, heh, heh . 
how did that happen . 
oh, my god . 
what . 
i suddenly had the feeling i was falling . 
but i'm not . 
so you and angela, huh . 
yep. pretty much . 
you're a lucky man . 
yeah . 
you know what i miss the most about her . 
that cute nibbley noise she makes when she eats . 
like a happy little squirrel or a weasel . 
i never really noticed . 
oh, yeah, yeah. listen for it . 
monica. monica is great . 
yeah. yeah, she is . 
but it's not gonna last . 
she's too much for me in bed . 
sexually . 
i've gotta tell you, bob is terrific . 
yeah, isn't he . 
it's so great to meet a guy who's smart and funny and has an emotional age beyond 8 . 
you know what else? he's unbelievable in bed . 
wow . 
my brother never even told me when he lost his virginity . 
huh . 
that's nice . 
you can do this. it's like pulling off a band-aid . 
just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed . 
go! go . 
janic . 
hi, janice . 
okay, here we go. i don't think we should go out anymore . 
janice . 
all right . 
wel . 
well, there you go . 
stop it, stop it, stop it . 
okay, i know this is gonna sound really stupid but i feel that if i can do this if i can actually do my own laundry there isn't anything i can't do . 
that does not sound stupid to me . 
no, it's like the first time i had to make dinner for myself after carol left me i'm sorry, that's all the time we have. next on ros . 
okay . 
uh-oh . 
what, "uh-oh" . 
uh-o . 
uh-oh, the laundry's done . 
it's a song . 
the laundry song that we sing . 
what's the matter . 
nothing. nothing . 
come on, show me . 
it's just that you left a red sock in with your whites, and now everything's kind of pink . 
oh . 
everything's pink . 
except for the red sock, which is still red . 
don't be upset. it can happen to anyone . 
but it didn't. it happened to me . 
god, i'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep . 
what am i doing? what am i doing . 
my father's right! i can't live on my own . 
i can't even do laundry . 
something went wrong with underdog and they couldn't get his head to inflate . 
so anyway his head is, like, flopping down broadway . 
and i'm thinking how inappropriate this is . 
i've got something's in my eye. joey, could we check it in the light, please . 
oh, my god . 
what . 
hello! were we at the same table? it's like cocktails in appalachia . 
come on, they're close . 
close? she's got her tongue in his ear . 
like you've never got a little rambunctious with ross . 
joey, this is sick. it's disgusting. it's not really true, is it . 
who's to say what's true . 
what were you thinking . 
look, i'm not proud of this, okay . 
well, maybe i am a little . 
oh . 
ow . 
i'm out of here . 
wait! come on . 
you like him. i want her . 
he likes you . 
really . 
yeah . 
i'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us we can break them up . 
i'm so sorry. i can't believe i did this . 
i just couldn't stop laughing at your norman mailer story . 
waiter? one more plate of chicken wings over here . 
here's the thing. it's like we're different . 
i'm the bing, you're the boom  ow . 
oh . 
oh, my god . 
ow . 
i'm so sorry . 
ow . 
are you okay . 
ow . 
it's just my lens. it's my lens . 
i'll be right back . 
i hit her in the eye! i hit her in the eye . 
this is the worst breakup in the history of the world . 
oh, my god . 
how many of those have you had . 
i don't know. a million . 
chandler, shh, shh. easy, easy. go to your happy place . 
i'm fine, i'm fine . 
all right . 
i'm not fine. here she comes . 
wait here, okay? breathe . 
how do you do that . 
it's like a gift . 
we should always, always break up together . 
i'd like that . 
you got the clothes clean. that's the important part . 
i guess. except everything looks like jammies now . 
whoa, i'm sorry . 
excuse me. we had this cart . 
i had a 24-inch waist. you lose things . 
now, come on. get out of my way . 
i'm sorry. maybe i wasn't being clear. this was our cart . 
hey, hey, hey. there aren't any clothes in it . 
hey, hey, hey! quit making up rules . 
let go! come on, this is my cart. you know i saw it first . 
listen, mitzi, if you want this cart you're gonna have to take me with it . 
yes! did you see that . 
you were incredible . 
a brand-new woman, ladies and gentlemen . 
i could not have done this without you . 
okay, u . 
uh more clothes in the dryer . 
i'm fine. i'm fine . 
are you sure . 
are you sure you're okay . 
yeah . 
does it still hurt . 
yeah . 
what a neat idea. all your clothes match. i'm gonna do this . 
hi . 
how'd it go . 
excellent . 
we ripped that couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves . 
what a beautiful story . 
i'm fine, by the way . 
i'm sorry . 
where's chandler . 
he needed some time to grieve . 
i'm free! i'm free . 
that ought to do it . 
oh, look, look! there's joey's picture . 
this is so exciting . 
you can spot someone who's never seen his plays . 
notice, no fear. no sense of impending doom . 
the exclamation point scares me . 
it's not just freud, it's freud . 
shh. magic is about to happen . 
well, eva we've done some excellent work here . 
and i would have to say your problem is quite clear . 
what you envy's a schwan . 
a thing through which you can tinkl . 
to play with or simply let han . 
i feel violated . 
did anybody else feel like peeling their skin off to have something else to do . 
ross, 10:00 . 
is it? it feels like 2 . 
no, 10:00 . 
there's a beautiful woman 00 . 
hello . 
she's amazing . 
she makes the women i dream about look like short, fat, bald men . 
go over to her. she's not with anyone . 
and what would my opening line be . 
excuse me come on, she's a person. you can do it . 
could she be more out of my league? ross, back me up . 
he could never get a woman like that in a million years . 
but you always see these beautiful women with these "nothing" guys . 
you could be one of those guys . 
you could do that . 
you think . 
absolutely . 
i can't believe i'm even considering this . 
i'm very aware of my tongue . 
come on . 
here goes . 
yes . 
hi. um ahem . 
okay, next word would be uh, chandler . 
chandler is my name and, u . 
hi . 
yes, you said that . 
yes! yes, i did. but what i didn't say what i wanted to say was, uh would you like to go out with me? thank you. good night . 
chandler . 
there he is . 
i didn't know you could dance!  you were in a play . 
what'd you think . 
i didn't know you could dance!  you were in a play . 
come on, it wasn't that bad. i was the lead . 
it was better than the troll thing. at least you got to see my head . 
you're right.  we saw your head . 
she said yes! she said yes . 
wow . 
awful play, man! whoa . 
her name's aurora. she's italian and she pronounces my name "chandler. . 
i like that better. the usher gave me this to give to you . 
what is it . 
the estelle leonard talent agency . 
an agency left me its card. maybe they wanna sign me . 
based on this play . 
based on this play . 
hey, kids . 
hey, chandler . 
no, because this line is passion, and this is just a line . 
i've been here seven seconds, and you haven't asked me how my date went . 
how was your date, chandler . 
it was unbelievable . 
i've never met anyone like her. she's had the most amazing life . 
she was in the israeli army . 
none of the bullets hit the engine block so we made it to the border . 
but just barely and i i've been talking about myself all night long. i'm sorry . 
what about you? tell me your stories . 
all right, once once i got on the subway, right . 
and it was at night and i rode it all the way to brooklyn just for the hell of it . 
we talked till 2. it was this perfect evening . 
more or less . 
suddenly, we realized we were in yemen . 
i'm sorry, so "we" is . 
we" is me and rick . 
who's rick . 
who's rick . 
my husband . 
ooh . 
oh, so you're divorced . 
no . 
i'm sorry. so you're widowed? hopefully . 
no, i'm still married . 
so how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me sliding your foot so far up my leg you can count the change in my pocket . 
don't worry . 
i imagine he'd be okay with you because he's okay with ethan . 
ethan? there's an ethan . 
ethan is my boyfriend . 
what . 
so, uh, what kind of relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend . 
i suppose, mainly sexual . 
huh . 
i'm sorry it didn't work out . 
what not work out? i'm seeing her again on thursday . 
didn't you listen to the story . 
how could you get involved with a woman like this . 
i had trouble with it at first, but i get all the good stuff . 
all the fun, all the talking, all the sex and no responsibility . 
this is every guy's fantasy . 
that is not true. ross, is this your fantasy . 
no, of course not . 
yeah. yeah, it is . 
you'd go out with someone else who's going out with someone else . 
i couldn't . 
good for you . 
when i'm with a woman, i need to know that i'm going out with more people than she is . 
you know monogamy can be a tricky concept . 
i mean, anthropologicall . 
fine. now you'll never know . 
we're kidding. tell us . 
we wanna know.  come on . 
all right. there's a theory put forth by richard leake . 
ta-da . 
are we greeting each other this way now? i like that . 
look! i cleaned . 
i did the windows. i did the floors . 
i used all the attachments on the vacuum except for that round one . 
i don't know what it's for . 
nobody knows, and we're not supposed to ask . 
what do you think . 
it's very clean.  really, it looks great . 
oh. heh. i see you moved the green ottoman . 
uh-oh . 
how did that happen . 
i don't know. i thought it looked better there . 
and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table . 
yeah, it's interesting . 
but you know what? just for fun let's see what it looked like in the old spot . 
just to compare . 
let's see. ha . 
well, it looks good there too . 
let's leave it there for a while . 
i can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman . 
thank god you didn't fan out the magazines . 
she'll scratch your eyes out . 
you guys, i am not that bad . 
yeah, you are . 
remember, i lived with you . 
you were a little, you kno . 
that is so unfair . 
when we were kids, yours was the only raggedy ann doll that wasn't raggedy . 
okay, so i'm responsible. i'm organized . 
but, hey, i can be a kook . 
all right, you madcap gal . 
try to imagine this . 
the phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away . 
why not . 
because you're a kook . 
instead, you wait until they send you a notice . 
i could do that . 
okay, then you let me go grocery shopping and i buy laundry detergent . 
but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout . 
why would someone do that . 
one might wonder . 
a glass is on the table. there's no coaster . 
it's a cold drink. it's a hot day . 
beads of condensation are inching their way closer to the woo . 
stop it . 
oh, my god . 
it's true. who am i . 
monica, you're mom . 
uh-huh? oh, my god . 
okay . 
okay, i'll be there . 
that was my agent . 
my agent has just gotten me a job in the new al pacino movie . 
whoa! that's great . 
what's the part . 
can you believe this? al pacino . 
this guy's why i became an actor . 
i'm out of order? you're out of order . 
this whole courtroom's out of order! . 
seriously, what's the part . 
just when i thought i was out, they pull me back in! . 
come on. seriously, joey, what's the part . 
you're, you're what . 
i'm his butt double, okay . 
i play al pacino's butt . 
all right? he goes into the shower, and then i'm his butt . 
oh, my god . 
come on, you guys . 
this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it and that's big . 
oh, no, it's terrific . 
after all your years of struggling you've finally been able to crack your way into show business . 
okay, fine. make jokes, i don't care . 
this is a big break for me . 
you're right. it is . 
so are you gonna invite us all to the big opening . 
i need to borrow some moisturizer . 
for what . 
what do you think? today's the big day . 
okay, go into the bathroom. use whatever you want . 
just don't ever tell me what you did in there . 
thank you . 
joey's mom's on the phone . 
he's in the bathroom . 
you don't wanna go in there . 
come on, we're roommates . 
my eyes! my eyes . 
i warned you . 
who is being loud . 
oh, that would be monica . 
can i borrow some things? i wanna make aurora breakfast . 
you got the whole night, huh . 
well, i only have 20 minutes until ethan, s . 
do i sense a bit of resentment . 
no, no, no. no resentment. believe me it's worth it, okay . 
in a relationship, you have these key moments you'll remember for the rest of your life . 
well, every single second is like that with aurora . 
and i've just wasted 35 of them talking to you . 
so, uh, monica, can you help me with the door . 
um, chandler, you know, the old monica would remind you to scrub that teflon pan with a plastic brush . 
but i'm not gonna do that . 
damn it! hire the girl . 
okay, everybody ready . 
uh, listen, i just wanna thank you for this great opportunity . 
lose the robe . 
me . 
that would work . 
right. okay. losing the robe . 
okay, and the robe is lost . 
everybody, i would like to get this in one take . 
let's roll it . 
water's working . 
and action . 
and cut . 
butt guy, what are you doing . 
i'm showering . 
no, that was clenching . 
well, the way i see it, the guy's upset here, you know . 
his wife's dead, his brother's missing . 
i think his butt would be angry here . 
i think his butt would like to get the shot before lunch . 
once again, rolling. water working . 
and action . 
and cut! what was that . 
i was going for quiet desperation . 
but if you have to as . 
god, i love these fingers . 
thank you . 
no, actually, i meant my fingers . 
look at them. look at how happy they are . 
oh, my god, i'm late . 
oh, no, no, no . 
don't go, don't go . 
okay, okay . 
i have to . 
look, she's leaving . 
i'm sorry. he'll be waiting for me . 
i thought you talked to rick . 
it's not rick . 
ethan? he gets the whole day with you . 
no, it's andrew . 
i know there'll be many moments when i'll regret asking the following question, bu . 
and andrew is . 
he's new . 
so you're not completely fulfilled by rick, ethan and myself . 
no, that's not exactly what i was most women would kill for three guys like us . 
so, what do you want . 
you . 
you have me . 
no, no. just you . 
what do you mean . 
lose the other guys . 
like, all of them . 
come on, we're great together. why not . 
why can't we just have what we have now . 
why can't we just talk, laugh and make love without feeling obligated to one another . 
up until tonight, i thought that's what you wanted too . 
well, part of me wants that but it's like i'm two guys . 
i mean, one guy's saying, "shut up! this is great! . 
but there's this other guy . 
it's the guy who wells up every time the grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device . 
he's saying, you know, "this is too hard. get out, get out! . 
so which one of the two guys will you listen to . 
i have to listen to both. they don't let each other finish . 
which one . 
the second guy . 
i see . 
call me if you change your mind . 
sorry, the first guy runs the lips . 
look at it this way. you dumped her . 
right? i mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy and beautiful, intelligent, unattainabl . 
tell me why you did this again . 
hey!  hey . 
movie star . 
aren't you the guy who plays the butt in the new al pacino movie . 
nope . 
no? what happened, big guy . 
big guy . 
it felt like a "big guy" moment . 
i got fired . 
they said i acted too much with it . 
i told everybody about this . 
everybody will be expecting to see me . 
you know what? no one will be able to tell . 
my mom will . 
there's something so sweet and disturbing about that . 
i've done nothing but crappy plays for six years and i finally get my shot, and i blow it . 
maybe this wasn't your shot . 
i think when it's your shot, you know it's your shot . 
did it feel like your shot . 
hard to tell. i was naked . 
i don't think this was your shot . 
i don't even think you just get one shot . 
i really believe big things are gonna happen for you. i do . 
you've gotta keep thinking about the day that some kid will go "i got the part! i'm gonna be joey tribbiani's ass! . 
you think? that's so nice . 
oh, come here . 
i'm sorry, joey. i'm gonna go to bed, guys . 
good night . 
you're gonna leave your shoes out here . 
uh-huh . 
really? just casually strewn about in that reckless, haphazard manner . 
it doesn't matter. i'll get them tomorrow. or not . 
whenever . 
she is a kook . 
if it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes . 
no, don't do this . 
this is stupid . 
i don't have to prove anything. i'm gonna go get them . 
but then everyone will know . 
unless i get them, and then wake up really early and put them back . 
i need help . 
everybody. shh. uh, central perk is proud to present the music of miss phoebe buffay . 
thanks . 
hi. um, i wanna start with a song that's about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is really all about . 
okay, here we go .

she's right. it's jill. jill goodacre . 
oh, my god . 
i am trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre .

yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot . 
yeah, i'm fine. i'm just stuck at the bank in an atm vestibule . 
jill says vestibule i'm going with vestibule . 
i'm fine . 
no, i'm not alone . 
i don't know. some guy . 
oh, some guy. i am some guy . 
hey, jill, i saw you with some guy last night . 
yes, he was some guy . 
hey, everyone . 
officiating at tonight's blackout is rabbi tribbiani . 
chandler's old roommate was jewish, and these are the only candles we have so happy hanukkah . 
ooh, look. ugly naked guy lit a bunch of candles . 
ooh . 
oh . 
ooh. that had to hurt . 
all right, all right. it's been 14 and a half minutes and you still haven't said one word. oh, god . 
do something. just make contact. smile . 
there you go . 
you're definitely scaring her . 
uh, would you like to call somebody . 
yeah, about 300 guys i went to high school with . 
yeah, thanks . 
hello . 
it's me . 
it's chandler . 
are you okay . 
yeah, i'm fine . 
with jill goodacre . 
what . 
in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre . 
i have no idea what you said . 
what's up, man . 
in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre . 
oh, my god . 
he's trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre . 
chandler, listen . 
come on, somebody . 
i'll go. i'll go . 
okay, um, senior year of college, on a pool table . 
ooh . 
pool table . 
that's my sister . 
okay, okay. my weirdest place would have to be the women's room on the second floor of the new york city public library . 
oh, my god. what were you doing in a library . 
pheebs, what about you . 
oh, um, milwaukee . 
uh, ross . 
disneyland, 1989. "it's a small world after all. . 
no way . 
the, uh, ride broke down so carol and i went behind a couple of those mechanical dutch children . 
they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the magic kingdom . 
ooh. rachel . 
i already went . 
you did not go . 
yes, i did . 
tell us. come on . 
all right, uh, the weirdest place would have to be the foot of the bed . 
step back . 
we have a winner . 
i've never had a relationship with that kind of passion . 
where you have to have somebody right there in the middle of a theme park . 
it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line . 
well, barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature-golf course . 
come on . 
no . 
he said we were holding up the people behind us . 
and you didn't marry him because . 
do you think there are people that go through life never having that kind of . 
probably . 
really . 
i'll tell you something. passion is way overrated . 
yeah, right . 
it is . 
eventually, it kind of burns out . 
but hopefully what you're left with is trust and security and, uh in my ex-wife's case, lesbianism . 
for all those people who miss out on that, uh, passion thing there's other good stuff . 
okay . 
but, um, i don't think that'll be you . 
you don't . 
mm-mm . 
see, i see, uh big passion in your future . 
really . 
mm-hm . 
you do . 
i do . 
ross, you're so great . 
ah . 
it's never gonna happen . 
what . 
you and rachel . 
why not . 
because you waited too long to make your move and now you're in the "friend zone. . 
no, no, no. i'm not in the zone . 
no, ross. you're mayor of the zone . 
look, i'm taking my time, all right . 
i'm laying the groundwork . 
every day i get a little bit closer to, u . 
priesthood . 
ross, i'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking . 
if you don't ask her out soon, you'll end up stuck in the zone forever . 
i will, i will . 
i'm waiting for the, uh, right moment . 
what . 
what, now . 
yeah . 
what's messing you up? the wine . 
the candles? the moonlight? huh . 
you gotta go up to her and say, "look, rachel, i think . 
shh . 
shh . 
what are we shushing . 
we're shushing because we're trying to hear something . 
what . 
uh, don't you hear that . 
ah . 
see . 
huh . 
would you like some gum . 
oh. is it sugarless . 
uh, sorry, it's not . 
then, no, thanks . 
what the hell was that . 
if jill goodacre offers you gum, you take it . 
if she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it . 
new york city has no powe . 
and the milk is getting sou . 
but to me it is not scar . 
cause i stay away from dair . 
la-la la-la-la-la-l . 
here goes . 
you'll do it . 
i'll do it . 
want help . 
you come out there, you're a dead man . 
ross, ross . 
good luck, man . 
thanks . 
okay . 
okay . 
where you going?  outside . 
you can't go out there . 
why not . 
because of, uh, the reason . 
and that would be . 
i, uh i can't tell you . 
what's going on . 
okay, listen. you gotta promise you'll never, ever tell ross that i told you . 
about what . 
he's planning your birthday party . 
oh, my god. i love him . 
you better act surprised . 
about what . 
my surprise party . 
what surprise party . 
oh, stop it. joey already told me . 
well, he didn't tell me . 
don't look at me. this is ross' thing . 
this is so typical. i'm always the last to know everything . 
you are not. we tell you stuff . 
uh-huh . 
i was the last one to know when chandler got bit by the peacock at the zoo . 
i was the last to know you had a crush on joey when he was moving in . 
what . 
oh. looks like i was second to last . 
it's so nice . 
hey, i have a question . 
uh, actually, it's not so much a question it's more of a general wondering ment . 
okay . 
okay . 
here goes . 
um, well, for a while now, i've been wanting to, u . 
oh . 
yes, that's right . 
look at that little kitty . 
what . 
i'm on the top of the world looking down on creatio . 
and the only explanation i can fin . 
is the love that i found ever since you've been aroun . 
all right, this is just bactine. it won't hurt . 
ow. ow . 
sorry, that was wax . 
poor little tootie's scared. we should find his owner . 
why not put "poor little tootie" in the hall . 
during a blackout? she'll get trampled . 
yeah . 
you know, on second thought, gum would be perfection . 
gum would be perfection . 
gum would be perfection . 
could've said, "gum would be nice." "i'll have a stick." but, no . 
for me, gum is perfection . 
i loathe myself . 
oh, no, the mellons. they hate all living things, right . 
oh . 
hi. we just found this cat and we're looking for the owner . 
um, yeah, it's, uh it's mine . 
he seems to hate you. are you sure .

no, i mean tonight, in the building? suddenly into our lives . 
the cat turned out to be paolo's cat. isn't that funny . 
that is funny. and rachel keeps touching him . 
i looked all over the building and i couldn't find the kitty anywhere . 
oh, i found him. it was paolo's cat . 
ah. well, there you go. last to know again . 
and i'm guessing, since nobody told me, this is paolo . 
oh. paolo, this is phoebe . 
you betcha . 
all right. okay. what next . 
blow a bubble. a bubble's good . 
it's got a, uh, boyish charm. it's impish .

this is so un-me . 
if you want, i'll do it . 
i know. i just wanna bite his bottom lip . 
but i won't . 
god. the first time he smiled at me those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in bermuda with barry . 
did you rent mopeds . 
because i've hear . 
oh, it's not about that right now. okay . 
i know it's totally superficial, and we have nothing in common and we don't even speak the same language but, god . 
paolo, hi . 
ross .

rachel and i ar . 
we're kind of a thing . 
thing . 
thing. yes, thing . 
you have the sex . 
no . 
no, no. um, technically, the sex is not being had. but that's, u . 
that's not the point . 
the point is that, uh, rachel and i should be, uh well, rachel and i should be together . 
and if you get in the, u . 
in bed . 
no . 
ha. no, not where i was going . 
if you get in the way of us becoming a thing then, uh, i would be, well, very sad .

well, goodbye, chandler .

hey, gorgeous. how's it going . 
dehydrated japanese noodles under fluorescent lights . 
does it get better than this . 
question: you're not dating, are you . 
i met somebody who would be perfect for you .

okay. bye-bye . 
it's hard to enjoy noodles after that. is that ridiculous . 
can you believe she actually thought that . 
u . 
yeah . 
well, when i first met you, i thought maybe possibly you might be . 
you did . 
then you spent phoebe's birthday party talking to my breasts so then i figured maybe not . 
huh. did, uh, any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me . 
i did . 
i think so . 
not me . 
no, no, me neither . 
although, uh, back in college, susan saladore did . 
you're kidding . 
did you tell her i wasn't . 
no . 
it's because i wanted to go out with her too . 
so i told her, actually, you were seeing bernie spellman who also liked her . 
well, this is fascinating . 
so, uh, what is it about me . 
i don't know. because you're smart, you're funny ross is smart and funny. you ever think that about him . 
ha, ha. yeah, right . 
what is it . 
okay, i don't know. you just you have a quality . 
yes, exactly . 
right . 
yeah, a quality . 
a quality." good. i was worried you were gonna be vague about this . 
hello . 
oh. rachel . 
it's paolo calling from rome . 
oh, my god. calling from rome . 
so he's calling from rome. i could do that . 
just gotta go to rome . 
monica, your dad just beeped in. can you make it quick . 
i'm talking to rome . 
hey, dad. what's up . 
oh, god . 
ross, it's nana . 
hey . 
how you doing?  hey, dad . 
so, uh, how's she doing . 
the doctor says it's a matter of hours . 
how are you, mom . 
me? i'm fine, fine . 
i'm glad you're here . 
what's with your hair . 
what . 
what's different . 
nothing . 
oh, maybe that's it . 
she's unbelievable. her mother' . 
okay, relax, relax . 
we are gonna be here a while, it looks like . 
we still have boyfriends and your career to cover . 
oh, god . 
the fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse . 
oh . 
yeah, they were gross . 
oh, you know what i love . 
her sweet 'n lows . 
how she was always stealing them from restaurants . 
not just restaurants, from our house . 
mrs. geller . 
she looks so small . 
i know . 
well, at least she's with pop-pop and aunt phyllis now . 
goodbye, nana . 
bye, nana . 
ross . 
nurse . 
what is going on . 
you know, uh, how the nurse said nana had passed . 
well, she's not quite . 
what . 
she's not passed . 
she's present. she's back . 
what's going on . 
she may have died . 
she may have died" . 
we're looking into it . 
uh, i'll go see . 
this almost never happens . 
now she's passed . 
i just have to know, okay . 
is it my hair . 
yes, chandler, that's exactly what it is. it's your hair . 
yeah, you have homosexual hair . 
hey.  hi . 
so did she . 
twice . 
oh, that sucks . 
you guys okay . 
i don't know. it's weird . 
i know she's gone, but i just don't feel, uh maybe that's because she's not really gone . 
no, no, she's gone . 
we checked . 
a lot . 
no, i mean, maybe no one ever really goes . 
ever since my mom died, every now and then i get this feeling that she's, like, right here, you know . 
oh. and debbie, my best friend from junior high got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course . 
i always get this strong debbie vibe whenever i use one of those little yellow pencils . 
i miss her . 
aw. here, pheebs . 
want this . 
oh, thanks . 
sure . 
i just sharpened her this morning . 
see, i don't believe any of that. i think when you're dead you're dead. you're gone. you're worm food . 
so chandler looks gay, huh . 
i don't know who this is, but it's not debbie . 
i thought it'd be a closed casket . 
well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice . 
sweetie, you think you can get in there . 
i don't see why not . 
here's my retainer . 
i was just thinking when my time come .

i wanna be buried at sea. it looks like fun . 
define "fun. . 
come on. you'll make a day of it. you'll get a boat, pack a lunch and then we throw your body in the water. gee, that does sound fun . 
everyone thinks they know me . 
everyone says, "jack geller, so predictable. . 
maybe after i'm gone, they'll say, "buried at sea? huh. . 
that's probably what they'll say . 
i'd like that . 
hey, gorgeous . 
hey . 
look, i'm sorry about yesterday . 
don't worry about it. apparently, other people have made the same mistake . 
oh. okay. phew . 
so, uh, what do you think it is about me . 
i don't know what . 
you just have a quality . 
a quality. right. great . 
it's a shame, because you and lowell would've made a great couple . 
lowell? financial services lowell? that's who you saw me with . 
what? he's cute . 
well, yeah . 
he's no brian in payroll . 
is brian . 
no. i don't know. the point is, if you were gonna set me up i'd like to think it'd be with somebody like him . 
well, i think brian's a little out of your league . 
excuse me. you don't think i could get a brian . 
because i could get a brian. believe you me . 
i'm really not . 
this one . 
no . 
i've shown you every dress we have . 
unless you want her to spend eternity in a lemon-yellow pantsuit go with the burgundy . 
whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one . 
you're right. we'll go with the burgundy . 
a fine choice. i'm coming out . 
wait. we need shoes . 
okay. u . 
how about these . 
that's really a day shoe . 
and where she's going, everyone else will be dressier . 
could we see something in a slimmer heel . 
okay. i have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy . 
i can show you something in a silver that may work . 
no, it really should be burgundy . 
unless we go with a different dress . 
yes . 
no, no, no. watch this . 
wait, i may have something in the back . 
oh, my god .

i love you the most . 
well, you know who i love the most . 
no . 
you . 
oh, you don't get it .

uh, just a, uh, hearing disability . 
what's the score . 
7-14, giants. three minutes to go in the third . 
beautiful . 
pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker . 
your grandmother would've hated this . 
well, sure. what with it being her funeral and all . 
no, i'd be hearing about why didn't i get the honey-glazed ham . 
or i didn't spend enough on flowers. . 
why waste your money? i don't need flowers, i'm dead. . 
that sounds like nana . 
do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say . 
i can imagine . 
i tell you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person she is . 
that is a wonder . 
so tell me something, mom. if you had to do it all over again i mean, if she was here right now would you tell her . 
tell her what . 
how she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail . 
like your hair, for example . 
i'm not sure i know what you're getting at . 
would things have been better if you'd just told her the truth . 
no . 
i think some things are better left unsaid . 
i think it's nicer when people just get along . 
ha . 
more wine, dear . 
oh, i think so . 
those earrings look really lovely on you . 
thank you . 
they're yours . 
actually, they were nana's . 
no . 
now i'm depressed . 
even more than i was . 
hey, who's this little naked guy . 
uh, that little naked guy would be me . 
aw. look at the little thing . 
yes, fine. that is my penis . 
can we be grownups now . 
who are those people . 
got me . 
that's nana right there in the middle . 
wow . 
yeah, let's see . 
me and the gang at java joe's. . 
wow. monica, you look just like your grandmother . 
how old was she there . 
let's see. "1939. . 
uh, twenty-four, twenty-five . 
huh. it looks like a fun gang . 
ooh, look, look, look. i got monica naked . 
let me see . 
no, no. that would be me again . 
i'm, uh, just trying something . 
hey, lowell . 
oh, hey, chandler . 
so how's it going in financial services . 
it's like mardi gras without the papier-mâché heads . 
how about you . 
good. good. listen, um, heh i don't know what shelly told you about me, but, uh i'm not . 
i know. that's what i told her . 
really . 
yeah . 
so you can tell . 
pretty much. most of the time. we have a kind of radar . 
so you don't think i have a quality . 
speaking for my people, i'd have to say no . 
by the way, your friend brian from payroll? he is . 
he is . 
yep . 
and way out of your league . 
out of my league . 
i could get a brian. if i wanted to get a brian, i could get a brian . 
hey, brian . 
terry, i know i haven't worked here very long but i was wondering, do you think it would be possible if i got a $100 advance on my salary . 
an advance . 
it's so that i can spend thanksgiving with my family . 
see, every year, we go skiing in vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket but i've sort of started this whole independent thing, you know which is actually why i took this "job. . 
rachel, rachel, sweetheart . 
you're a terrible, terrible waitress . 
really, really awful . 
okay, i hear what you're saying. i'm with you . 
um but i'm trying really hard, and i think i'm doing better . 
i really do . 
does anybody need coffee . 
yeah, over here.  yeah, i do . 
heh. look at that . 
excuse me, sir? hi. you come in here all the time . 
uh-huh . 
i was just wondering you think there's a possibility you could give me an advance on my tips . 
huh? no . 
okay, okay. that's fine, fine. sorry about that spill before . 
only 98.50 to go . 
hey. hey.  hey . 
ross, did you know that mom and dad are going to puerto rico for thanksgiving . 
what? no, they're not . 
yes, they are. the blymans invited them . 
you're wrong . 
i am not wrong . 
you're wrong . 
no, i just talked to them . 
i'm calling mom . 
hey, hey.  hey . 
hey . 
coffee . 
are you wearing makeup . 
yes, i am . 
as of today, i am officially joey tribbiani, actor/model . 
thank you . 
that's funny, i was thinking you look more like joey tribbiani, man/woman . 
what were you modeling for . 
you know those posters for the city free clinic . 
oh, wow. you're gonna be one of those healthy, healthy, healthy guys . 
ah . 
the asthma guy's really cute . 
oh, he is.  isn't he . 
you know which one you're gonna be . 
no, no . 
but i hear lyme disease is open, so, you kno . 
good luck, man. i hope you get it . 
thanks . 
well, you were right. how can they do this to us, huh . 
it's thanksgiving . 
aw. tell you what. how about if i cook dinner at my place . 
i'll make it just like mom's . 
will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps . 
you know they're not actually supposed to . 
i'll work on the lumps . 
joey, you're going home, right . 
yeah . 
and i assume, chandler, you're still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays . 
yes, every single one of them . 
phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma . 
yeah, and her boyfriend . 
but we're celebrating thanksgiving in december because he's lunar . 
so you're free thursday, then . 
yeah. oh, can i come . 
yeah . 
rach, you still thinking you're gonna make it to vail . 
absolutely. shoop, shoop, shoop . 
only $102 to go . 
i thought it was 98.50 . 
yeah, well, it was, but i broke a cup . 
well, i'm off to carol's . 
ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her . 
ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife and will probably wanna bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner . 
hi. is carol here . 
no, she's at a faculty meeting . 
oh . 
well, i just came by to pick up my skull . 
well, not mine, bu . 
come in . 
thanks . 
yeah, carol borrowed it for a class, and i have to get it back to the museum . 
what's it look like . 
kind of like a big face without skin . 
yes, heh, i'm familiar with the concept . 
we can just look for it . 
okay . 
wow, you guys, heh, sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian . 
well, you know, you have to take a course . 
otherwise they don't let you do it . 
hey, hey, yertle the turtle. a classic . 
actually, i'm reading it to the baby . 
the baby that hasn't been born yet . 
uh, wouldn't that mean you're crazy . 
what, you don't think they can hear sounds in there . 
you're not serious. i mean, you really talk to it . 
yeah, all the time. i want the baby to know my voice . 
do you, uh? do you talk about me . 
yeah, yeah. all the time . 
really . 
but, um, we just refer to you as "bobo the sperm guy. . 
look, if she's talking to it, i just think i should get some belly time too . 
i mean, not that i believe any of this . 
oh, i believe it. i think the baby can totally hear everything . 
really . 
i can show you . 
this will seem a little weird . 
but you put your head inside this turkey and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say . 
i'd just like to say i'm totally behind this experiment . 
in fact, i'd very much like to butter your head . 
hey.  hey, rach . 
did you make your money?  no, not even close . 
forget vail. forget seeing my family . 
forget shoop, shoop, shoop . 
uh, rach here's your mail . 
thanks. you can just put it on the table . 
heh. no . 
here's your mail . 
thanks. you can just put it on the table . 
would you just open it . 
oh, my god . 
oh, you guys are great . 
aw. ha, ha . 
aw . 
we all chipped in . 
we did . 
you owe me 20 bucks . 
thank you. thank you so much . 
chandler, here you go. got your traditional holiday feast . 
got your tomato soup your grilled-cheese fixings, and your family-size bag of funyuns . 
wait, this is what you're having for thanksgiving dinner . 
what is it with you and this holiday . 
all right, i'm 9 years old . 
aw . 
aw, i hate this story . 
we've just finished thanksgiving dinner . 
i have and i remember this part vividly . 
a mouthful of pumpkin pie . 
and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced . 
oh, my god . 
it's very difficult to enjoy thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse . 
hi . 
we used to work together . 
we did . 
yeah, at macy's. you're the obsession girl, right . 
yes . 
i was the aramis guy . 
aramis? aramis? aramis . 
oh . 
yeah, right . 
i gotta tell you, you're the best in the business . 
get out.  i'm serious . 
you're amazing. you know when to spritz. you know when to lay back . 
really? you don't know what that means to me . 
mm, mm . 
you smell great tonight. uh, what are you wearing . 
nothing . 
listen, do you wanna go get a drink or something . 
yeah, that would b . 
what's wrong . 
i just remembered i have to do something . 
oh. what . 
u . 
leave . 
whoa. wait, wait, wait . 
so i guess you all saw it . 
what . 
saw what . 
no, we're just laughing. you know how laughter can be infectious . 
hey . 
set another place for thanksgiving. my entire family thinks i have vd . 
tonight, on a very special blossom . 
mm, looking good. okay . 
cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming . 
what . 
i don't know . 
it's just not the same without mom in the kitchen . 
ugh. all right, that's it. get out of my way and stop annoying me . 
well, that's closer. that' . 
i got the ticket, i got the ticket . 
five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop . 
oh, you must stop shooping . 
okay, i'm gonna get my stuff . 
chandler, will you just come in, already . 
no, thank you. i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment . 
look out. incoming pumpkin pie . 
okay, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore . 
hey, monica, i got a question. i don't see any tater tots . 
that's not a question . 
but my mom always makes them. it's like a tradition . 
you get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot . 
i mean, it's bad enough i can't be with my family because of my disease . 
all right, fine . 
tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps and in the form of tots . 
yes . 
all right, i'm off to talk to my unborn child . 
ah . 
okay, mom never hit . 
okay, all done . 
what? phoebe, did you whip the pota . 
ross needs lumps . 
oh, i'm sorry. oh, i just i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions . 
why would we do that . 
then they'd be just like my mom used to make it you know, before she died . 
okay, three kinds of potatoes coming up . 
okay. goodbye, you guys . 
thanks for everything . 
oh, god, look at sorry. i'm so sorry . 
the most unbelievable thing has happened. underdog has gotten away . 
the balloon . 
no, no, the actual cartoon character . 
of course the balloon . 
it's all over the news. before he reached macy's he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park . 
i'm going to the roof. who's with me . 
well, i can't. i gotta go . 
an 80-foot inflatable dog loose over the city . 
how often does that happen . 
almost never . 
got the keys . 
okay . 
any time you're ready . 
okay . 
okay, here we go . 
oh okay, where am i talking to here? i mean, uh well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, bu . 
just aim for the bump . 
okay . 
okay, okay . 
okay, here goes . 
you know, i you know, i can't do this . 
this is it's too weird. i feel stupid . 
all right, so don't do it. it's fine . 
you don't have to do it just because susan does it . 
hello, baby. hello, hello . 
that moment when we first saw the giant dog shadow fall over the park . 
but did they have to shoot him down? i mean, that was just mean . 
okay, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside . 
why are we standing here . 
we're waiting for you to open the door. you've got the keys . 
no, i don't . 
yes, you do. when we left, you said, "got the keys. . 
no, i didn't. i asked, "got the keys? . 
no, no, no. you said, "got the keys. . 
either of you have the keys . 
the oven is on . 
oh, i've gotta get my ticket . 
wait. we have a copy of your key . 
well, then get it, get it . 
hey, hey. that tone won't make me go any faster . 
joey . 
that one will . 
you gotta pick a major. you gotta pick a major. . 
so on a dare, i picked paleontology . 
and you have no idea what i'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus . 
you're just happy you don't have gills anymore . 
look, you don't have to talk to it. you can sing to it . 
oh, please. i am not singing to your stomach, okay . 
how's it going?  shh, shh, shh . 
walkin' down the stree . 
get the funniest looks from everyone we mee . 
hey, he . 
hey, uh, did you just feel that . 
i did . 
well, does it always, uh . 
no, no, that was the first . 
keep singing. keep singing.  oh . 
and i can't wait to meet yo . 
when you come out i'll buy you a bagel and then we'll go to the zo . 
i felt it that time . 
hey, hey, i'm your dadd . 
i'm the one without any breast . 
nope, not that one . 
can you go any faster with that . 
hey, i got one keyhole and about a zillion keys . 
you do the math . 
why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway . 
for an emergency just like this . 
all right, listen, smirky . 
if it wasn't for your stupid balloon i would be on a plane, watching a woman do this right now . 
but i'm not . 
i swear you said you had the keys . 
no. i wouldn't say i had the keys unless i had the keys . 
and i obviously did not have the keys . 
okay, all right, that's it. enough with the keys. no one say "keys. . 
why would i have the keys . 
aside from the fact that you said you did . 
but i didn't . 
well, you should have . 
why?  because . 
why? because everything is my responsibility . 
isn't it enough that i'm making thanksgiving dinner . 
everyone wants a different kind of potato, so i'm making different kinds of potatoes . 
you know, does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want . 
no, no, no . 
you know, just as long as phoebe gets her peas and onions and mario gets his tots . 
it's all burnt, and i can't okay, monica, only dogs can hear you now, s . 
look, the door's open. here we go . 
oh, god . 
ooh . 
oh . 
well, the turkey's burnt . 
potatoes are ruined. potatoes are ruined. potatoes are ruined . 
walkin' down th . 
this doesn't smell like mom's . 
no, it doesn't, does it? but you wanted lumps, ross . 
well, here you go, buddy. you got one . 
oh, god, this is great . 
the plane is gone, so i guess i'm stuck here with you guys . 
hey, we all had better plans, okay? this was nobody's first choice . 
oh, really . 
so why was i busting my ass to make this delicious thanksgiving dinner? . 
you call that delicious . 
you be quiet . 
all right, stop it, stop it, stop it . 
now, this feels like thanksgiving . 
ew . 
what . 
ugly naked guy's taking his turkey out of the oven . 
eh . 
oh, my god. he's not alone . 
ugly naked guy is having thanksgiving dinner with ugly naked gal . 
i gotta see this . 
aw . 
all right, ugly naked guy . 
ooh, ugly naked dancing . 
it's nice that he has someone . 
shall i carve . 
by all means . 
all right . 
okay, who wants light cheese and who wants dark cheese . 
i don't even wanna know about the dark cheese . 
does anybody wanna split this with me . 
ooh, i will . 
mm. you guys have to make a wish . 
make a wish . 
come on, you know, thanksgiving . 
ooh. you got the bigger half. what did you wish for . 
the bigger half . 
all right, i'd like to propose a toast . 
a little toast here. ding, ding, ding.  mm . 
this isn't exactly the kind of thanksgiving you planned but for me this has been really great, you know . 
i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting . 
i was just thinking, if you'd gone to vail or if you guys had been with your family, or if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be all together, you know . 
so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked . 
that's so sweet . 
thank you . 
mm . 
and hey, here's to a lousy christmas . 
and a crappy new year . 
hear, hear . 
guys? there's, uh, somebody i'd like you to meet . 
wait, wait. what is that . 
that would be marcel. you wanna say hi . 
no. no, i don't . 
oh, he is precious. where did you get him . 
my friend bethel rescued him from some lab . 
that is so cruel . 
why? why would a parent name their child bethel . 
hey, that monkey's got a ross on his ass . 
ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment . 
yeah. i mean, it's been kind of quiet since carol left, s . 
why don't you just get a roommate . 
ah, i don't know. you reach a certain age having a roommate is just kind of pathe uh, sorry, that's "pathet," which is sanskrit for "really cool way to live. . 
you guys, i'm doing all-new material tonight . 
i have 12 new songs about my mother's suicide and one about a snowman . 
might want to open with the snowman . 
hey, joey . 
hey . 
hey, joe . 
so how'd it go . 
ah, i didn't get the job . 
how could you not get it? you were santa last year . 
i don't know. some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager . 
he's not even jolly. it's all political . 
so, what are you gonna be . 
i'm gonna be one of his helpers . 
it's just such a slap in the face, you know . 
do you guys know what you're doing for new year's . 
gee, what? what is wrong with new year's . 
nothing for you. you have paolo . 
you don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so can have somebody to kiss when the ball drops. man, i'm talking loud . 
well, for your information, paolo's gonna be in rome this new year's . 
so i'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you . 
yeah, you wish . 
it's just that i'm sick of being a victim of this dick clark holiday . 
i say this year, no dates, we make a pact . 
just the six of us. dinner . 
sure . 
fine . 
you know, i was hoping for a little more enthusiasm . 
woo . 
okay . 
phoebe, you're on . 
oh. oh, good . 
okay, hi. ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand miss phoebe buffay . 
thanks. hi . 
um, ahem, i want to start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year . 
and a smile so bewitchin . 
how was i supposed to kno . 
that my mom was dead in the kitchen . 
la-la-l . 
my mother's ashe . 
even her eyelashe . 
are resting in a little yellow ja . 
and sometimes when it's freezing  i'm being honest here . 
you don't agree . 
i feel a little sneezy  you're right . 
and now i excuse me? excuse me . 
yeah, noisy boys . 
is it something that you'd like to share with the group . 
no. no, that's okay . 
come on, if it's important enough to discuss while i'm playing then i assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear . 
that guy's going home with a note . 
nothing. i was just sayin . 
could you speak up . 
sorry . 
i was just saying to my friend, you were the most beautiful woman i'd ever seen . 
and you said daryl hanna . 
darryl hannah . 
was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life . 
and i said, yeah, i liked her in splash, but not so much in wall street . 
i thought she had a hard quality . 
a hard quality . 
and, uh, while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way you are, uh, luminous with a kind of delicate grace . 
then that's when you started yelling . 
okay, we're gonna take a short break . 
i think that guy's going home with more than a note . 
come here, marcel. sit here . 
pheebs, i can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet . 
i mean, god, by my sixth date with paolo i mean, he had already named both my breasts . 
ooh, did i just share too much . 
just a smidge . 
david's, like, you know, a scientist guy. he's very methodical . 
i think it's romantic . 
me too. oh . 
did you ever see an officer and a gentleman . 
yeah . 
well, he's kind of like the guy i went to see that with . 
except except he's smarter and gentler and sweeter . 
i just i just want to be with him all the time . 
you know, day and night. and night and day . 
and special occasions . 
wait a minute. i see where this is going. you're gonna ask him to new year's . 
you're gonna break the pact. she's gonna break the pact . 
no, no, no . 
yeah, could i just . 
yeah, because i already asked janice.  you what . 
come on, this was a pact. this was your pact . 
i snapped, okay? i couldn't handle the pressure and i snapped . 
yeah, but janice? that was, like, the worst breakup in history . 
i'm not saying it was a good idea. i'm saying i snapped . 
hi. hi, sorry i'm late . 
too many jokes . 
must mock joey . 
nice shoes, huh . 
aah, you're killing me . 
ross. he's playing with my spatulas again . 
look, he's not gonna hurt them, right . 
do you always have to bring him here . 
look, i didn't want to leave him alone, all right . 
we had our first fight this morning . 
i think it has to do with my working late. i said some things that i didn't mean . 
he threw some feces . 
you know, if you're gonna work late, i can look in on him for you . 
oh, that would be great. okay . 
but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay . 
and you're not, like, doing it as a favor to me . 
okay. but if he asks, i'm not going to lie . 
but you can't actually test this theory . 
because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions . 
okay. all right. i have a question then . 
yeah . 
were you planning on kissing me ever . 
uh, that's definitely a valid question and, uh, the answer would be yes . 
yes, i was . 
but see, i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment because, well, it's you . 
sure. yeah . 
right. but, see, the longer i waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be . 
and now, we've reached a place where it's just got to be one of those things where i sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it . 
and i'm not really a sweeping sort of fella . 
oh, david, i think you are a sweeping sort of fella . 
i mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a physicist's body . 
really . 
oh, yeah. i'm sure of it . 
you should just do it. just sweep and throw me. heh . 
now? now . 
right now. jus . 
okay. okay, okay . 
you know what? this is just really expensive . 
okay. and i'll tell you, this was a gift . 
so now you're just kind of tidying up . 
okay, what the hell? what the hell . 
you want me to actually throw you . 
i can hop . 
now, tell me something, what does the phase "no-date pact" mean to you . 
look, i'm sorry, okay . 
it's just that chandler has somebody and phoebe has somebody . 
i thought i'd ask fun bobby . 
fun bobby, your ex-boyfriend, fun bobby . 
yeah . 
you know more than one fun bobby . 
i happen to know a fun bob . 
okay. here we go . 
whoa, whoa, whoa. there's no room for milk . 
there. now there is . 
okay, so on our no-date evening three of you now are gonna have dates . 
uh, four . 
four . 
five . 
five . 
sorry. paolo's catching an earlier flight . 
yeah, and i met this really hot single mom at the store. ha, ha . 
what's an elf to do . 
okay, so i'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops . 
oh, come on. we'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who . 
hey, you know, this is so not what i needed now . 
what's the matter . 
oh, it's marcel . 
he keeps shutting me out, you know . 
he's walking around all the time, dragging his hands . 
that's so weird. i had such a blast with him the other night . 
really . 
yeah, we played. we watched tv . 
that juggling thing is amazing . 
what, uh . 
what juggling thing . 
with the balled-up socks? i figured you taught him that . 
no . 
you know, it wasn't that big a deal. i mean, just balled-up socks . 
and a melon . 
phoebe. hi . 
hi, max. do you know everybody . 
no. have you seen david . 
no, he hasn't been around .

i don't want to go to minsk to work with lipson and yamaguchi and flank . 
no, no, no. i want to stay here and make out with my girlfriend. .

sandy, hi. come on in. hey . 
ha, ha . 
you brought your kids . 
yeah. that's okay, right . 
party . 
that thing is not coming in here . 
that thing"? this is how you greet guests at a party . 
let me ask you something. if i showed up with my new girlfriend she wouldn't be welcome . 
i'm thinking your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table . 
he was more embarrassed about that than anyone . 
okay? and for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened all right. all right. just keep him away from me . 
thank you. come on, marcel . 
what do you say you and i do a little mingling . 
all right, i'll, uh, catch up with you later . 
oh, my gosh. rachel, honey are you okay? where's paolo . 
rome. jerk missed his flight . 
and then your face exploded . 
no. okay . 
i was at the airport getting into a cab when this woman this blond planet with a pocketbook starts yelling at me . 
something about how it was her cab first . 
and the next thing i know, she just starts pulling me out by my hair . 
and i started blowing my attack whistle thingy and then three more cabs show up . 
so as i'm going to get into a cab, she tackles me . 
and i hit my head on the curb and cut my lip on my whistle . 
oh! everybody having fun at the party . 
are people eating my dip . 
you know, when i saw you at the store last week it was probably the first time i ever mentally undressed an elf . 
wow, that's, uh, dirty . 
ha, ha . 
yeah . 
hey, kids . 
look at him. i'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me but at least check in . 
there you are . 
you got away from me . 
but you found me . 
here, ross, take our picture . 
smile. you're on janice camera . 
kill me. kill me now. ha, ha . 
everybody, it's fun bobby . 
fun bobby . 
hey, bobby .

but i couldn't get a flight out till tomorrow, so here i am . 
hey, fun bobby. how's it going, man . 
whoa. who died . 
it's going to be an open casket, you know . 
so at least i'll get to see him again . 
i'm gonna blow this one up and i'm gonna write "reunited" in glitter . 
all right, janice, that's it . 
janice? janice? ahem . 
hey, janice . 
when i invited you to this party, i didn't think it meant that w . 
oh, no . 
i'm sorry you misunderstood . 
oh, my god . 
you listen to me, chandler. you listen to me . 
one of these times, it's just gonna be your last chance with me . 
oh, will you give me the thing . 
hi, max . 
yoko . 
i've decided to go to minsk without you . 
wow . 
it won't be the same but it will still be minsk . 
happy new year . 
are you all right . 
yeah, i'm fine. i'm fine . 
you're going to minsk . 
no, i'm not going to minsk . 
oh, you are so going to minsk . 
you belong in minsk. you can't stay here just because of me . 
yes, i can. because if i go, it means i have to break up with you . 
and i can't break up with you . 
oh, yes. yes, you can . 
just say, uh, "phoebe, i love you, but my work is my life . 
and that's what i have to do right now. . 
and i say, "your work? your work? how can you say that? . 
and then you say, um, "it's tearing me apart but i have no choice. can't you understand that? . 
and i say, "no. no. i can't understand that. . 
uh, ow . 
sorry. um and then you put your arms around m . 
and then you put your arms around me . 
oh, oh. sorry . 
and, um and then you tell me you love me and you'll never forget me . 
i'll never forget you . 
and then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't want to start the new year with me if you can't finish it . 
i'm gonna miss you you scientist guy . 
hi, this is dick clark live in times square . 
we're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in times square . 
it gets bigger and better every year . 
here you go, kids . 
and then the peacock bit me. ha, ha . 
please kiss me at midnight . 
you seen sandy . 
ooh. i don't know how to tell you this but, uh, she's in monica's bedroom getting it on with max, that scientist geek . 
oh, look at that. i did know how to tell you . 
what . 
the ball is dropping . 
in 20 seconds, it'll be midnight . 
and the moment of joy is upon us . 
looks like that "no-date pact" thing worked out . 
everybody looks so happy. i hate that . 
not everybody is happy. hey, bobby . 
one. happy new year . 
you know, i just thought i'd throw this out there. i'm no math whiz but i do believe there are three girls and three guys right here . 
oh, i don't feel like kissing anyone tonight . 
i can't kiss anyone . 
so i'm kissing everyone . 
no, no, no. you can't kiss ross. that's your brother . 
perfect. perfect. so now everybody's getting kissed but me . 
all right. somebody kiss me . 
somebody kiss me. it's midnight. somebody kiss me. it's midnight . 
all right. all right. all right . 
there . 
i wanted this to work so much . 
i'm still in there, you know . 
changing his diapers. picking his fleas . 
but he's just phoning it in . 
it's just so hard to accept that something you love so much doesn't love you back, you know . 
i think that bitch cracked my tooth . 
do you think they have yesterday's daily news . 
why . 
i just wanna check my horoscope see if it was right . 
oh, my god. phoebe. don't look now, but, behind you there's a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into depression . 
where . 
ooh, come to mama . 
okay, he's coming. be cool. be cool. be cool . 
nice hat.  thanks . 
we should do something. whistle . 
we're not gonna whistle . 
yeah, come on, do it . 
no . 
do it. do it. do it . 
woo-hoo . 
i can't believe you did that . 
why did i woo-hoo . 
i mean, what was i hoping? . 
ooh, i love that sound. i must have you now" . 
i just wish there was something we could do . 
hello. hello, coma guy . 
get up, you girl scout! up, up, up . 
phoebe, what are you doing . 
maybe nobody's tried this . 
i wish we at least knew his name . 
would you look at that face . 
i mean, even sleeping he looks smart. i bet he's a lawyer . 
yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? that means he's artistic . 
okay. he's a lawyer who teaches sculpting on the side . 
and he can dance . 
and he's the kind of guy who, when you're talking, he's listening you know, and not saying, "yeah, i understand" but wondering what you look like naked . 
oh, stop it . 
i wish all guys could be like him . 
i know . 
are there no conscious men in the city for you two . 
he doesn't have anyone . 
yeah. we feel kind of responsible . 
i can't believe you said, "woo-hoo. . 
i don't even say, "woo-hoo. . 
oh, she's coming up. she's coming up . 
folks, when we come back we'll talk about her new book euphoria unbound with always-interesting nora tyler bing. put the kids to bed for this one . 
don't watch this. weekend at bernie's is on showtime and hbo and cinemex . 
no way . 
come on. she's your mom . 
exactly. weekend at bernie's . 
dead guy getting hit in the groin 20, 30 times . 
no . 
chandler, i gotta tell you i love your mom's books. i love her books . 
i cannot get on a plane without one. i mean, this is so cool . 
you wouldn't think it's cool if you were 11 and all your friends were passing around page 79 of mistress bitch . 
come on, chandler. i love your mom. i think she's a blast . 
you can say that. she's not your mom.  oh, please. she's the  hi, sweetie . 
when did rigatoni get back from rome .

so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire . 
just a dream i had . 
but, phew . 
hey, hey, hey. she's on . 
ah. nora bing . 
before we get to the book . 
what is this about you being arrested in london? what is that about . 
your mom was arrested . 
shh, i'm busy beaming with pride . 
this is kind of embarrassing but occasionally after i've been intimate with a ma . 
why would she say that's embarrassing . 
shh . 
i just get this craving for kung pao chicken . 
that's too much information . 
so now you're doing this book tour thing. how's that going . 
oh, fine. i'm leaving for new york tomorrow, which i hate . 
but i get to see my son, who i love . 
oh . 
this is the way that i find out. most moms use the phone . 
you know, don't take this wrong, i just don't see you as a mom somehow . 
i don't mean that bad . 
oh, no. i'm a fabulous mom . 
i bought my son his first condoms . 
and then he burst into flames . 
let's see. "congress is debating a new deficit-reduction bill . 
the mayor wants to raise subway fares again . 
the high today was 45. . 
and, oh. and teams played sports . 
what about glen?  no . 
he could be a glen . 
mm-mm. not special enough . 
ooh, how about agamemnon . 
way too special . 
i'm famished. what do i want . 
please, god, don't let it be kung pao chicken . 
oh, you watched the show. what did you think . 
well, i think you need to come out of your shell jus . 
what is this dive . 
only you could've picked this place . 
oh . 
come on. shut up. it's fun . 
hi.  give me a hug . 
well, i think we're ready for some tequila . 
i know i am . 
who's doing shots . 
hit me . 
i'm in . 
there you go. ross . 
uh, i'm not really a shot-drinking kind of guy . 
hi. sorry. sorry we're late . 
we, uh, kind of just, you know, lost track of time . 
but a man can change . 
anyone want me to appraise anything . 
mrs. bing, i have to tell you, i've read everything you've ever written . 
no, i mean it. when i read euphoria at midnight all i wanted to do was become a writer . 
oh, please, honey. if i can do it, anybody can . 
you just start with half a dozen european cities throw in 30 euphemisms for male genitalia and, bam, you have got yourself a book .

she's supposed to be with you . 
you're good . 
oh, ross, listen to me. i have sold 100 million copies of my books and you know why . 
the girl on the cover with her nipples showing . 
no, because i know how to write men that women fall in love with . 
believe me, i cannot sell a paolo . 
people will not turn 325 pages for a paolo . 
come on. the guy's a secondary character . 
he's just a you know, a complication you eventually kill off . 
when . 
he's not a hero . 
you know who our hero is . 
the guy on the cover with his nipples showing . 
no, it's you . 
please . 
no, really . 
come on. you're smart. you're sexy . 
right .

in bizarro-world . 
you broke the code . 
what code .

but not a mom. never a mom . 
what are you guys doing out here . 
uh, well, joey and i had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game . 
but, um, apparently somebody overslept . 
yeah, well, you don't have your racquet . 
no. no, i don't, because it's being restrung . 
ahem. somebody was supposed to bring me one . 
yeah. well, you didn't call and leave your grip size . 
okay, you guys are spending way too much time together . 
okay, i'm scum. i'm scum . 
ross, how could you let this happen . 
i don't know . 
well, it's not like she's a regular mom. you know? she's sexy. she' . 
you don't think my mom's sexy . 
well, not in the same way . 
i'll have you know that gloria tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, all right . 
you think it's easy giving birth to seven children . 
huh . 
okay, i think we're getting into a weird area here . 
aah . 
hey . 
hey . 
what are you guys doing out here . 
well, ha, ha, not playing racquetball . 
he forgot to leave his grip size . 
he didn't get the goggles .

what are you doing here . 
nothing. i just thought i'd stop by, you know, after the, ahem that i, you know. um, so, what are you doing here . 
i'm not really here . 
i just thought i'd drop these off on the way. my way . 
do you, um, come here a lot without me . 
no, no, no . 
so, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning . 
how would i know? i wasn't here .

joey . 
aah! uh . 
rach .

yeah, i thought i'd give it a shot. i'm still on the first chapter . 
now, do you think his "love stick" can be "liberated from its denim prison" . 
yeah, i'd say so . 
and there's no "j" in "engorged. . 
hey, rach . 
hey . 
hello . 
hello . 
you going to the hospital tonight .

phoebe just started i believe i was talking to joey. all right, there, mother-kisser . 
mother-kisser. . 
i'll shut up . 
chandler, can i say something? i know you're still mad at me . 
i just wanna say that there were two people there that night, okay . 
there were two sets of lips . 
yes, well, i expect this from her . 
okay? she's always been a freudian nightmare . 
okay, but if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something . 
because it's complicated. it's complex . 
hey, you kissed my mom . 
we're rehearsing a greek play . 
that's funny. we done now . 
no . 
okay, you mean you're not gonna talk to her, tell her how you feel . 
that would be a no. just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her, all right? trust me, you can't talk to her . 
okay. "you can't"? or you can't . 
okay, that's my finger. okay, that's my knee . 
still doing the play . 
all right, what did you do with him . 
you're awake .

i feel good . 
who are you . 
sorry . 
i'm phoebe buffay . 
i'm monica geller. i've been taking care of you .

well, what do you want me to say . 
well, i don't know . 
maybe, uh . 
that was nice . 
it meant something to me . 
i'll call you. . 
all right. i'll call you . 
i don't think you mean that . 
this is so typical . 
you know, we give and we give and we give . 
and then we just get nothing back . 
and then one day, it's just, you know, you wake up and "see you around. . 
let's go, phoebe . 
you know what? we thought you were different . 
but i guess it was just the coma . 
the car's running downstairs . 
i wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends . 
anything you want from lisbon . 
no, just knowing you're there is enough . 
all right. well, be good. i love you . 
you kissed my best ross . 
or something to that effect . 
okay . 
look, it was stupid . 
really stupid . 
really stupid . 
and i don't even know how it happened . 
i'm sorry, honey. i promise it will never happen again . 
are we okay now . 
yeah . 
no. no . 
ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door . 
shh . 
he did it. he told her off. and not just about the kiss, about everything . 
you're kidding . 
no . 
he said, "when are you gonna grow up and start being a mom? . 
wow. . 
the question is, when are you gonna grow up and realize i have a bomb? . 
okay, wait. are you sure she didn't say . 
when are you gonna grow up and realize i am your mom? . 
that makes more sense . 
you think . 
yeah . 
so, what's going on now . 
i don't know. i've been standing here spelling it out for you . 
i don't hear anything. wait, wait, wait . 
what do you see . 
it's hard to tell. they're so tiny and upside down . 
wait, wait, wait . 
they're walking away. they're walking away . 
no, they're not. they're coming right at us. run, run . 
you okay, kiddo . 
yeah, i'm okay . 
all right. you be good . 
drive safe . 
mrs. bing . 
mr. geller . 
hey . 
you mean that . 
yeah, why not . 
so i told her . 
oh . 
how did it go . 
awful. awful . 
couldn't have gone worse . 
well, how do you feel . 
pretty good . 
i told her . 
well, see . 
so maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, you know, me kissing your mom, huh . 
but we don't have to go down that road . 
now, this is just the first chapter and i want your absolute honest opinion. okay . 
oh, and on page two, he's not reaching for her "heaving beasts. . 
what's a "niffle" . 
you can usually find them on the heaving beasts . 
all right, all right, so i'm not a great typist . 
wait, did you get to the part about his "huge, throbbing pens" . 
tell you, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those . 
all right, that's it. give them back.  no . 
no, no, we're done. we're done, man . 
aunt silv, stop yelling . 
all i'm saying is, if you had told me vegetarian lasagna i would've made vegetarian lasagna . 
well, the meat's only every third layer . 
maybe you could scrape . 
ross, did you really read all these baby books . 
yep. you could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus no compass and i could find my way out like that . 
ooh, this is cool . 
it says in some parts of the world people actually eat the placenta . 
and we're done with the yogurt . 
sorry . 
aunt silv, i did this as a favor. i am not a caterer . 
what do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas . 
nice talk, aunt silv . 
you kiss uncle freddie with that mouth . 
hey, ross, listen . 
do you know that right now your baby is only this big . 
this is your baby . 
heh . 
hello . 
how come you don't live with mommy . 
how come mommy lives with that other lady . 
what's a lesbian . 
honey, you can say it. it's poconos. poconos . 
it's like "poke a nose. . 
ah . 
poke a nose . 
so did i hear "poconos" . 
yes . 
my sister's giving us her place for the weekend . 
woo-hoo. first weekend away together . 
yeah, it's a big step.  i know . 
it's just a weekend. big deal . 
wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh . 
shouldn't it be flung by now . 
i mean, we are way past the "fling" thing . 
i'm feeling things i've only read about in danielle steel books, you know . 
i mean, when i'm with him, i'm just totally, totall . 
nauseous. i'm physically nauseous . 
what am i supposed to do, huh? call lmmigration . 
i could call lmmigration . 
i love babies with their little baby shoes and their little baby toes and their little hands okay, you're gonna have to stop that forever . 
need a new table . 
you think . 
hey, hey, hey. come on in . 
hey. hello . 
i brought the books and monica sends her love along with this lasagna . 
oh, great . 
is it vegetarian? because susan doesn't eat meat . 
i'm pretty sure that it is. yeah . 
so i got the results of the amnio today . 
oh, tell me. is everything . 
totally and completely healthy . 
oh, that's great. that is great . 
ha, ha . 
ah . 
hey. when did you and susan meet huey lewis . 
uh, that's our friend tanya . 
of course it's your friend tanya . 
don't you wanna know about the sex . 
the sex . 
yeah, i'm having enough trouble with the image of you and susan together . 
but when you throw in tany . 
the sex of the baby, ross . 
oh. you know the sex of the baby . 
uh-huh . 
oh, oh, oh . 
do you want to know . 
no, no, no . 
no, i don't want to know. absolutely not . 
no, i think you shouldn't know until you look down there and see, "oh, there it is. . 
or isn't . 
oh. hello, ross . 
susan . 
so . 
so did you hear . 
yes, we did. everything's a-okay . 
oh, that's so cool . 
it really is. ha, ha . 
do we know . 
we certainly do. it's going to be  . 
hey, hey . 
ho, ho! hello . 
see, a guy who doesn't wanna know standing right here . 
oh. ha, ha. uh, well, is it what we thought it would be . 
mm-hm . 
aah . 
what . 
okay, what did we think it' was gonna be? no, no, no . 
i don't want to know. don't want to know. okay . 
you know, i should probably just go . 
well, thanks for the books . 
no problem. okay . 
susan . 
all right, who should we call first? your folks or deb and rhona . 
hello . 
u . 
never mind. i don't wanna know . 
okay, so just because it was my table, i have to buy a new one . 
that's the rule . 
what rule? there's no rule . 
if anything, you owe me a table . 
how did you get there . 
i believe this piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with angela delveccio . 
you knew about that . 
the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination . 
okay, okay. how about if we split it . 
what do you mean, like, buy it together . 
yeah . 
do you think we're ready for something like that . 
why not . 
well, it's just a big commitment . 
i mean, what if one of us wants to move out . 
why, are you moving out . 
i'm not moving out . 
you'd tell me if you were moving out, right . 
yes, it's just that, with my last roommat . 
oh, i know all about kip . 
we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married and things got pretty ugly . 
so let me ask you something . 
was kip a better roommate than me . 
oh, don't do that . 
you've got a couple changes in your schedule . 
0 herbal massage 30 . 
and ms. summerfield 30 shiatsu .

yeah, well, rachella's right. yeah . 
oh . 
okay, i don't know what you just said, so let's just start . 
uh, i am, uh being naked . 
um, that's really your decision . 
i mean, some people prefer, you know, to take of . 
ooh, oops! being naked . 
i can't believe you don't want to know. i mean, i could not know . 
i mean, if the doctor knows, and carol knows, and susan know . 
and monica knows . 
heh. how could you? i don't even know . 
carol called to thank me for the lasagna. i asked. she told me . 
so, what's it going to be . 
whoa . 
huh? oh, great. now he knows and i don't know . 
i'm sorry. i'm just excited about being an aunt . 
or an uncle . 
hey, phoebe. hey, pheebs . 
fine . 
phoebe, what's the matter . 
nothing. i'm sorry . 
i'm just i'm out of sorts .

i'm familiar with his work, yes . 
look, he made a move on me . 
whoa. the store will be open tomorrow . 
more coffee over here, please . 
well, what happened . 
well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine unti . 
my god . 
are you sure . 
oh, yeah. i'm sure . 
and all of a sudden, his hands weren't the problem anymore . 
was it . 
oh, boy scouts could've camped under there . 
ooh . 
ooh," what . 
ma thurman . 
oh . 
the actress . 
uma thurman . 
thanks, rach . 
what are you gonna you do . 
you have to tell her . 
you have to tell her. it's your moral obligation as a friend as a woman. i think it's a feminist issue. guys? guys . 
oh, yeah, you have to tell her . 
feminist issue? that's where i went . 
she is gonna hate me . 
yeah, well . 
will you pick one? just pick one . 
here, how about that one . 
that's patio furniture . 
so what? like people are gonna come in and think, "uh-oh, i'm outside again. . 
fine . 
what about the birds . 
i don't know. birds just don't say . 
hello, sit here. eat something. . 
you pick one . 
how about the ladybugs . 
oh, so forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining . 
fine. do you want the birds? get the birds . 
not like that, i won't . 
kip would've liked the birds . 
hey . 
hi, pheebs . 
are you moving out . 
no, these aren't all of my suitcases . 
this one's paolo's . 
u . 
um, rachel, can we talk for a sec . 
well, sure. just for a sec, though because paolo's on his way over . 
oh . 
okay. u . 
okay . 
u . 
oh, pheeb . 
um, okay . 
um, ahem. we haven't known each other for that long a time . 
and, um, there are three things that you should know about me . 
one, my friends are the most important thing in my life . 
two, i never lie . 
and three, i make the best oatmeal-raisin cookies in the world . 
okay. thanks, pheebs . 
mm, my god . 
why have i never tasted these before . 
oh, i don't make them a lot because i don't think it's fair to the other cookies . 
ahem, god . 
well, you're right. these are the best oatmeal-raisin cookies i've ever had . 
which proves that i never lie . 
i guess you don't . 
paolo made a pass at me . 
so, what do you think . 
i think it's the most beautiful table i've ever seen . 
i know . 
so how does this work? gonna balance the plates on these little heads . 
who cares? we'll eat at the sink. come on . 
heads up, ross . 
score! you suck . 
are you okay . 
i need some milk . 
i've got milk . 
here you go . 
better . 
no . 
ugh! i feel so stupid . 
i think about the other day, with you guys, you know . 
and i was all, "oh, paolo. he's so great . 
he makes me feel so" ugh . 
god . 
i'm so embarrassed . 
i'm the one he hit on . 
i unleashed him on you. if i'd never met him this would've never happened . 
i'm so sorry . 
no, i'm sorry . 
no, i'm sorry . 
oh, wait. oh . 
what are we sorry about . 
i don't know . 
right. he's the pig . 
such a pig . 
oh, god, he's such a pig . 
oh, he's like a big disgusting pi . 
yeah, like  . 
pig man . 
yes, good. okay . 
oh, but he was my pig man . 
how did i not see this . 
oh, i know . 
because he's gorgeous . 
and he's charming . 
and when he looks at yo . 
okay. okay, pheebs . 
the end . 
ugh. god . 
should i not have told you . 
no, trust me, it's much better that i know . 
uh, i just liked it better before. it was better . 
i think she took it pretty well . 
you know, paolo's over there right now, so yeah, we should get over there and see if she's okay . 
just one second . 
whoo! score . 
game. us . 
yes . 
come on, pheebs . 
whoo . 
well, it looks like, uh, we kicked your butts . 
no, no. she kicked our butts . 
you could be on the olympic "standing there" team . 
come on. two on one . 
what are you still doing here? she just broke up with the guy . 
it's time for you to swoop in . 
what? now . 
yes. now is when you swoop . 
you gotta make sure that when paolo walks out the first guy rachel sees is you . 
she's got to know that you're everything he's not . 
you're like like the anti-paolo . 
my catholic friend is right . 
she's distraught. you're there for her . 
you pick up the pieces, . 
the age of ross . 
see this? see . 
how's it going?  don't stare . 
she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony . 
now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving . 
okay, that is either, "how could you?" or "enormous breasts. . 
here he comes . 
uh, i am, uh to say goodbye . 
oh, okay, bye-bye . 
paolo . 
i really hate you for what you did to rachel. but i still have five of these so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles . 
paolo, i just wanna tell you and i think i'd speak for everyone when i say  oh. just look at her . 
oh, you guys, i really think only one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed . 
oh, right . 
and i really think it should be me . 
hey . 
you all right . 
oh. i've been better . 
come here . 
listen you deserve so much better than him . 
you know? i mean, you you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you . 
ros . 
what . 
i'm so sick of guys . 
i don't want to look at another guy . 
i don't want to think about another guy . 
i don't even want to be near another guy . 
huh . 
ross, you're so great . 
oh, ha, ha . 
are you all right?  are you okay . 
medium. heh . 
any cookies left . 
yeah . 
heh. see, rach, um see, i don't think swearing off guys altogether is the answer. i really don't . 
i think what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process . 
no. no. i just need to be by myself for a while . 
you know? i just gotta figure out what i want . 
no, no . 
see, because not all guys out there are gonna be a paolo . 
no, i know. i know . 
and i'm sure your little boy's not gonna grow up to be one . 
what . 
what . 
uh, no . 
no. in fact, you're not having a boy . 
i'm having a boy . 
you're having a boy . 
aah . 
i'm having a boy. i'm having a boy . 
yes . 
what . 
what is it . 
i'm having a boy. i'm having a boy . 
hey . 
i'm having a son . 
u . 
yes. and that would be a shutdown . 
where you guys going? come on, one more game . 
0 in the morning . 
yeah. get out . 
you guys are always hanging out in my apartment . 
come on, i'll only use my left hand, huh . 
come on, wussies . 
all right. okay. i gotta go . 
mm-hm . 
i'm going . 
and i'm gone . 
one more game . 
oh, yeah . 
i'm sorry.  oh, my god. that's it . 
you just barge in here and you don't knock . 
you have no respect for anybody's privacy . 
rachel, wait . 
no, you wait . 
can i just say one thing . 
what? what . 
that's a relatively open weave and i can still see your nippular area . 
ugh . 
honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are other things . 
you know . 
like when the phone rings and she takes a showe . 
that's pretty much it . 
but you tell it really well, sweetie . 
thanks. okay . 
now go away so we can talk about you . 
okay. i'll miss you . 
isn't he great . 
he's so cute. and he likes you so much . 
i know. i know . 
he's so sweet. and so complicated, you know . 
and for a shrink, he's not too "shrinky." you know . 
so you think you'll do it on his couch . 
oh. i don't know. that's a little weird . 
it's vinyl . 
okay. you guys want anything else . 
oh, yes . 
could i have . 
sorry, we're all out . 
anybody else . 
okay . 
did i, uh, miss something . 
no, she's still upset because i saw her boobies . 
what were you doing seeing her boobies . 
it was an accident . 
i wasn't across the street with a telescope and a box of doughnuts . 
can we change the subject, please . 
because, hello? these aren't her "boobies." these are her breasts . 
pheebs, i was hoping for more of a change . 
i don't know why you're embarrassed. they were very nice boobies . 
nice" . 
they were "nice" . 
that's it? i mean, mittens are "nice. . 
okay. rock, hard place me . 
you're so funny . 
he's really funny . 
i wouldn't want to be there when the laughter stops . 
whoa, whoa. back up there, sparky . 
what did you mean by that . 
it seems that maybe you have intimacy issues that you use your humor to keep people at a distance . 
huh . 
i mean, hey, i just met you. i don't know you from adam . 
only child, right . 
parents divorced before you hit puberty . 
uh-huh. how did you know . 
it's textbook . 
hey, you guys . 
you all know my dad, right . 
how long are you in the city . 
a couple of days . 
i got a job midtown . 
i figure i'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry . 
i don't know this one . 
oh. this is my friend roger . 
hi . 
good to meet you.  you too . 
what happened to the, uh, puppet guy . 
dad, u . 
oh, oh . 
excuse me . 
so, ross, uh, how's the wife . 
oh for two, huh? heh . 
uh, chandler, quick, say something funny . 
gotta go. ha, ha. i miss you too . 
i love you, but it's getting late no . 
let me say hi. hey, ma . 
listen, i made the appointment with dr. bassida an . 
excuse me . 
did you know this isn't ma . 
her name's ronni . 
she's a pet mortician . 
sure . 
so how long have you been remember when you were a kid, i'd take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships . 
since then . 
no, it's only been six years . 
i wanted to give you a nice memory so you'd know i wasn't always such a terrible guy . 
joe, have you ever been in love . 
i don't know . 
then you haven't . 
you're burning your tomatoes . 
hmm. you're one to talk . 
joe, your dad's in love, bigtime . 
and the worst part is, it's with two different women . 
oh, man. please tell me one of them is ma . 
of course one of them's ma. what's the matter with you . 
it's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life . 
he's, like, actually some spy working for the cia . 
that'd be cool . 
this blows . 
i know. why can't parents just stay parents . 
why do they have to become people . 
why do they have . 
why can't you stop staring at my breasts . 
what . 
didn't you get a good enough look the other day . 
all right, we're all adults here . 
there's only one way to resolve this . 
since you saw her boobies i think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your pee-pee . 
you know, i don't see that happening . 
come on. he's right. tit for tat . 
well i'm not showing you my tat . 
hello . 
it's phoebe.  and rog . 
come on up . 
oh, good. rog is here . 
what's the matter with rog . 
nothing. it's a little thing . 
i hate that guy . 
what? so he was a little analytical. that's what he does . 
come on, he's not that bad . 
that's where you're wrong. why would i marry her if i thought on any level that she was a lesbian . 
i don't know . 
maybe you wanted your marriage to fail . 
ha, ha . 
why? why would i? why . 
why? why? why . 
i don't know. maybe low self-esteem . 
maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling. maybe wait. go back to that "sibling" thing . 
well, i don't know . 
it's conceivable that you sabotaged your marriage so the sibling would be less of a failure in the parents' eyes . 
that's ridiculous. i don't feel guilty for her failures . 
oh, so you think i'm a failure . 
isn't he good . 
yeah. no. that's not what i was saying . 
all these years, i thought you were on my side but maybe you were sucking up to mom and dad so they'd favor you . 
hey, i married a lesbian to make you look good . 
you're right . 
i mean, you're right . 
it wasn't just the weebles, but it was the weeble play palace and the weeble's cruise ship which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in . 
that's tough, tough stuff . 
pheebs, if we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta go . 
okay. feel better, okay . 
we're gonna be late, sweetie . 
okay . 
listen, thanks for everything, mon . 
no problem . 
it was great seeing you again . 
mon, uh, easy on those cookies, okay . 
remember, they're just food they're not love . 
i hate that guy . 
good night, you guys . 
oh, look. it's the woman we ordered . 
hey. can, uh can we help you . 
oh. no, thanks. i'm just waiting for, uh, joey tribbiani . 
i'm joey tribbiani . 
oh. oh, no, not you. big joey . 
oh, my god . 
you're so much cuter than your pictures . 
i'm ronni . 
cheese nip . 
uh, joey's having an embolism but i'd go for a nip . 
you see, most people, when their pets pass on they want them laid out like they're sleeping . 
but occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose . 
like, uh, chasing their tail . 
or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee . 
joey, if i go first, i want to be looking for my keys . 
that's a good one . 
hey, joe . 
hey, dad. ronni's here . 
huh . 
hi . 
hey.  hey . 
hello, babe . 
what are? what are you doing here . 
oh, uh, you left your hair at my apartment . 
i figured you'd need it for your meeting . 
thank you. uh so who's up for a big game of kerplunk . 
look, i, u . 
i shouldn't have come . 
i gotta go. i'll miss the last train . 
no, i don't want you taking that thing this late . 
where am i gonna stay? here . 
whoa . 
we'll go to a hotel . 
no, you won't . 
no, we won't . 
if you go to a hotel, you'll be doing stuff . 
i want you right here, where i can keep an eye on you . 
you're gonna keep an eye on us . 
that's right, mister . 
i don't care how old you are, while you're here you're gonna live by my rules . 
and that means no sleeping with your girlfriend . 
wow, he's strict . 
dad, you'll be in my room . 
ronni, uh, you can stay in chandler's room . 
thanks. you're a good kid . 
come on. i'll show you to my room . 
that sounds weird when it's not followed by, "no, thanks, it's late. . 
okay. this is just for tonight. starting tomorrow, you gotta change . 
six years is long enough . 
what kind of change . 
break up with ronn . 
i can't . 
then come clean with ma. this is not right . 
i don't wanna hear it. now go to my room . 
hey, kickie . 
what are you doing . 
trying to get comfortable . 
i can't sleep in my underwear . 
well, you're gonna . 
i've been thinking about how i'm always seeing girls on top of girls . 
are they end-to-end, or tall, like pancakes . 
you know what i mean. how i date all these women . 
i always figured, when the right one comes along i'll be able to be a standup guy and go the distance, you know . 
now i'm looking at my dad thinkin . 
you're not him, you're you . 
when they wanted you to go into your father's business, did you cave . 
no . 
no . 
you decided to go into the out-of-work-actor business . 
that wasn't easy, but you did it . 
and i believe that when the right woman comes along you'll have the guts to say . 
no thanks, i'm married. . 
you really think so . 
yeah. i really do . 
thanks, chandler . 
get off . 
hi . 
hi . 
may i help you . 
uh, joey said i could use your shower since, uh, chandler's in ours . 
okay. who are you . 
oh, uh, i'm ronni. ronni rapalono . 
uh-huh . 
the mistress . 
um, come on in . 
thanks . 
hi, i'm rachel. bathroom's up there . 
hey, ronni .

hey, mr. trib . 
hey. good morning, dear . 
chandler bing, it's time to see your thing . 
what's the matter with you . 
i thought it was chandler . 
you were supposed to be in there so i could see your thing . 
sorry, my thing was in there with me . 
hey.  hey, pheebs . 
how's it going .

we're sorry, pheebs . 
uh-huh. okay . 
don't you think maybe it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaked you out . 
no, i hate him . 
no, we hate him . 
i'm sorry . 
ma. what are you doing here . 
i came to give you this and this . 
ow . 
big ring . 
why did you fill your father's head with that garbage about making things right . 
things were fine the way they were . 
there's chicken in there. put it away . 
for god's sake, joey. really . 
hold on. you knew . 
of course i knew. what do you think . 
your father is no james bond . 
you should have heard his cover stories . 
i'm sleeping over at my accountant's. . 
i mean, what is that? please . 
so then, how could you . 
do you remember how your father used to be . 
always yelling. nothing made him happy . 
not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle . 
now he's happy . 
i mean, it's nice. he has a hobby . 
ma, i don't mean to be disrespectful, but what the hell are you talking about . 
i mean, what about you . 
me? i'm fine . 
look, honey in an ideal world there'd be no her and your father would look like sting . 
and i'll tell you something else . 
ever since that poodle-stuffer came along he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive . 
he's been more loving . 
it's like every day is our anniversary . 
i'm happy for you . 
well, don't be . 
because now everything's screwed up . 
i just want it the way it was . 
ma, i'm sorry . 
i just did what i thought you'd want . 
i know you did, cookie. oh, i know you did . 
so tell m . 
did you see her . 
yeah . 
you're 10 times prettier than she is . 
that's sweet . 
could i take her . 
with this ring, no contest . 
what's wrong, sweetie?  nothing . 
no, no. what's wrong? come on . 
okay . 
it's nothing. i'm fine . 
it's just, um it's my friends . 
they have a liking problem with you in that, um they don't . 
oh. they don't . 
but you know they don't see all of the wonderfulness that i see . 
they don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff . 
they think you're a littl . 
what . 
intense and creepy . 
oh . 
but i don't. me. phoebe . 
well, i'm not at all surprised they feel that way . 
you're not? see, that's why you're so great . 
actually, it's quite typical behavior when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic . 
you know, this kind of codependent emotionally stunted sitting in your stupid coffeehouse, with your stupid big cups which, i'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them . 
and you're all like, "oh, define me. define me . 
love me. i need love. . 
so you talked to your dad, huh . 
yeah. he's gonna keep cheating on ma, like she wanted . 
ma's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does . 
and my sister tina can't see her husband anymore because he got a restraining order . 
which has nothing to do with it, except that i found out today . 
wow . 
things sure have changed here on walton's mountain . 
so, joey, are you okay . 
yeah, i guess . 
it's just you know, they're parents . 
after a certain point, you gotta let go . 
even if you know better you gotta let them make their own mistakes . 
and just think in a couple years, we get to turn into them . 
oh, please . 
if i turn into my parents, i'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after 20-year-old boys or i'll end up like my mom . 
hey.  hey, pheebs . 
how's it going . 
okay, except i broke up with roger . 
oh . 
yeah, right . 
no, no, really. aw . 
what happened . 
ugh. i don't know. i mean he's a good person and he can be really sweet . 
and in some ways, i think he is so right for me . 
it's just, i hate that guy . 
hey, joey. what's going on . 
clear the tracks for the boobie payback express . 
next stop, rachel green . 
joey, what the hell were you doing . 
sorry, wrong boobies . 
hello, joey . 
hello, dear . 
i'm telling you, ross, she wants you . 
she barely knows me. we just live in the same building . 
any contact . 
she lent me an egg once . 
you're in . 
oh, right . 
hey, ross . 
hey . 
come on, ross. you gotta get back in the game here . 
the rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife's a lesbian, yo . 
i don't think we need a third . 
excuse me. could we get an egg over here, still in the shell . 
an egg . 
yeah. go up to her and say, "here's your egg back. i'm returning your egg. . 
i think it's winning . 
i think it's insane . 
she'll love it . 
thank you . 
thank you. here . 
go with the egg, my friend . 
go, go, go . 
think it'll work . 
it's suicide. the man's got an egg . 
you cannot do this.  what? do what . 
roger wants to take her out . 
no. pheebs. don't you remember why you dumped the guy . 
because he was creepy . 
and mean. and a little frightening . 
still, it's nice to have a date on valentine's day . 
hi . 
hi . 
you can go out with a creep any night of the year . 
i know i do . 
hi . 
hi . 
what are you doing tomorrow night . 
actually, tomorrow night depends on how tonight goes . 
oh. uh, listen, about tonigh . 
no, no, don't you dare bail on me . 
she's only going out with me because i'm bringing a friend for her friend . 
but her friend sounds like such a pathetic mess. i know, but come on, man, she's needy, . 
thanks . 
you haven't been out with a woman since janice. you're doing this . 
hi . 
hi . 
she said yes . 
ahem . 
yes! way to go, man . 
still got the egg, huh . 
yeah . 
how do i look . 
oh, um i don't care . 
there's lorraine . 
now, remember, no trading . 
you get the pretty one. i get the mess . 
hi, joey . 
hey . 
well, well . 
look what you brought . 
very nice . 
and what did you bring . 
she's checking her coat . 
joey, i'm gonna go wash the cab smell off of my hands . 
will you get me a white zinfandel and a glass of red for janice . 
janice . 
oh my god . 
hey, it's janice . 
okay, i'm making a break for it. i'm going out the window . 
no, don't, please. i've been waiting for forever to go out with lorraine . 
just calm down . 
calm down? calm down . 
you set me up with a woman i've dumped twice in the last five months . 
hey . 
can you stop yelling? you're making me nervous and i can't go when i'm nervous . 
i'm sorry. i'm sorry. you're right . 
come on! do it, do it, do it! come on . 
okay, roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to pete carney . 
which one was he . 
pete the weeper . 
remember the guy that used to cry every time we had sex . 
well, i'd take a little crying any day over howard, the "i win" guy . 
i win. i win. . 
i went out with him for two months. i didn't get to win once . 
how do we end up with these jerks? we're good people . 
i don't know. i think we're like some kind of magnets . 
i know i am. that's why i can't wear a digital watch . 
there's more beer, right . 
oh. you know my friend abby who shaves her head . 
she says to break the bad-boyfriend cycle you can do a cleansing ritual . 
pheebs, this woman is voluntarily bald . 
yeah . 
so we can do it tomorrow night, you guys . 
it's valentine's day. it's perfect . 
okay, well, what kind of ritual . 
okay, we can, um, burn the stuff they gave us . 
or . 
or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks . 
burning's good . 
burning's good . 
i've got stuff to burn . 
you know ever since i was little, i've been able to pick up quarters with my toes . 
yeah? good for you . 
uh, quarters or rolls of quarters . 
by the way, chandler, i cut you out of all of my pictures . 
so if you want, i have a bag with just your heads . 
that's okay . 
are you sure? because you could make little puppets out of them . 
and you could use them in your theater of cruelty . 
we can't do that . 
what? what can't you do . 
uh, can i talk to you for a second? over there . 
uh, we might be leaving now . 
tell me it's you and me "we. . 
she said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off . 
i'm not even sure what slathering is . 
but i definitely want to be a part of it . 
okay, you cannot do this to me . 
you're right. i'm sorry. you're right . 
uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go, please . 
i'm out of here . 
here's my credit card. dinner's on me. i'm sorry, chandler . 
i hope she throws up on you . 
thanks . 
s . 
just us . 
ugh, what a crappy night . 
although i have enjoyed the fact that your shirt's been sticking out of your zipper since you came back from the bathroom . 
excuse me . 
how you doing . 
so do we have the best friends, or what . 
joey's not a friend. he's a stupid man who left us his credit card . 
another drink? some dessert? a big-screen tv . 
i will go for that drink . 
you got it. good woman . 
a bottle of your most overpriced champagne . 
each . 
that's right. each . 
oh. and a, uh, rob roy . 
i've always wanted to know . 
happy valentine's day . 
oh, i miss you already . 
can you believe this happened . 
no, no . 
and yet it did . 
goodbye, janice . 
kiss me . 
oh, chandler. sorry . 
hey, janice . 
hi, monica . 
okay. well, this was very special . 
rach, come see who's out here . 
what's going on? oh, my god . 
janice. hi . 
janice is gonna go away now . 
i'll be right back . 
oh. joey. look who it is . 
whoa . 
oh, good. joey's home now . 
this is so much fun . 
this is like a reunion in the hall . 
hi, ross. there's someone i want you to say hi to . 
he just happened to call . 
hello, ross. yes, that's right. it's me. how did you know . 
i'm just saying if dogs do experience jet lag, then because of the whole seven-dog- years-to-one-human-year thing that when a dog flies from new york to los angeles he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses, like, a week and a half . 
that's funny . 
yeah . 
what . 
who are they . 
the, uh, blond is my ex-wife . 
and the woman touching her is her close personal friend . 
you mean they're lovers . 
if you want to put a label on it . 
wow. heh . 
anything else i should know . 
nope. that's it . 
oh, and she's pregnant with my baby . 
i always forget that part . 
hello . 
okay. so now we need, um, sage branches and the sacramental wine . 
all i had is oregano and a fresca . 
um, that's okay . 
ooh . 
okay . 
all right. now we need the semen of a righteous man . 
huh. okay, pheebs, if we had that we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place . 
can we start throwing things in . 
um, yeah, okay . 
oh. okay. u . 
okay. barry's letters . 
adam ritter's boxer shorts . 
and i have the receipt . 
a picture of scotty jared, naked . 
let me see . 
he's wearing a sweater . 
no.  ew . 
okay, and here we have the last of paolo's grappa . 
wait. isn't it almost pure . 
how can i dump this woman on valentine's day . 
i don't know. you dumped her on new year's . 
oh, man. in my next life i'm coming back as a toilet brush . 
hello, funny valentine . 
hi, just janice . 
hello, joey, our little matchmaker . 
i could just kiss you all over, and i'm gonna . 
oh. okay, heh. ha, ha, okay . 
if you don't do it, i will . 
so, um, what do you do for a living . 
well, um for the past few years oh, no. you said they could shoot the spot without you . 
i thought they could . 
working with children, which is really fulfilling . 
i'll try to get back as soon as i can. i'm sorry . 
so i'm spending most of my time teaching science, heh which is funny because that wasn't even my major . 
now, that is funny . 
hey, do you think . 
would it be too weird if i invited carol over to join us . 
because she's alone now . 
and pregnant. and sad . 
i guess . 
are you sure . 
thanks. carol . 
wanna come over and join us . 
oh, no. i'm fine . 
come on, stand up. these people will scooch down. come on . 
come over here. you guys will scooch, won't you . 
let's try scooching. come on . 
come on.  thank you . 
uh, kristen riggs, this is carol willet . 
carol, kristen . 
how do you do . 
um oh, uh, carol teaches sixth grade . 
and, uh, kristen kristen does something that, funnily enough wasn't even her major . 
what do we got there . 
a piece of silk boxer shorts some greeting cards what looks like a half-charred picture of wow, that guy's hairier than the chief . 
you know, it's a really funny story how this happened . 
it's all right. don't explain . 
it's not the first boyfriend bonfire we've seen get out of control . 
you're our third call tonight . 
really . 
sure. valentine's is our busiest night of the year . 
i brought you something . 
is it loaded . 
oh, little candy hearts . 
chan and jan forever. . 
i had them made special . 
okay, janice . 
janice . 
hey, janice . 
look, there's no way for me to tell you this . 
at least, there's no new way for me to tell you this . 
i just don't think things are gonna work out . 
that's fine . 
it is . 
mm-hm . 
because i know that this isn't the end . 
oh, no. you see, actually, it is . 
no, it isn't. because you won't let that happen . 
don't you know it yet . 
you love me, chandler bing . 
oh, no, i don't . 
then why do you think we keep ending up together . 
new year's, who invited who . 
valentine's, who asked who into whose bed . 
i did, bu . 
you seek me out . 
something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn . 
janice. janice . 
you want me. you need me . 
you can't live without me . 
and you know it . 
you just don't know you know it . 
see you . 
call me . 
it's not true. i never called your mother a wolverine . 
you did so. i swear. i swear t . 
how long has she been in the bathroom . 
uh, i don't think she's in the bathroom. her coat is gone . 
well, maybe it's cold in there . 
maybe i screwed up the first date i had in nine years . 
that could be it . 
oh, god . 
you know, this is still pretty hot . 
mushroom . 
smile . 
they won't all be like this. some might even stay through dinner . 
i'm sorry. that's not funny . 
no, it's just well, you know the whole getting-on-with-your-life thing . 
well, do i have to . 
i mean, well, i'm sitting here with this cute woman and she's perfectly nice, you know . 
but there' . 
that's it . 
and, uh, then i'm here talking to you, and it's easy and it's fun . 
and i don't have t . 
i know . 
you know . 
here's a wacky thought. um, ahem . 
let's say you and i give it another shot . 
ross . 
no, no, i know what you're gonna say. you're a lesbian . 
but what do you say we just put that aside for now, you know . 
let's just stick a pin in it, okay . 
because we're great together, you know . 
you can't deny it . 
and besides, you're carrying my baby . 
i mean, how perfect is that . 
ross you keep saying that, but there's something right here . 
i love you . 
i love you too . 
bu . 
no "but." no "but. . 
you know that thing we put over here with the pin in it . 
it's time to take the pin out . 
yeah . 
you'll find someone. i know you will. the right woman is waiting for you . 
it's easy for you to say. you found one already . 
all you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set . 
not her . 
we get off around midnight. why don't we pick you up then . 
okay.  great . 
so, um, will you bring the truck . 
i'll even let you ring the bell . 
wohoo . 
we'll see you later.  bye. see you later . 
thanks. see you . 
oh, my god . 
see, there you go . 
the cleansing worked.  you're right . 
they're nice guys . 
they're firemen guys . 
you tell them you're married?  no way . 
my girlfriend doesn't know. i'm not gonna tell them . 
coffee . 
thank you . 
cappuccino . 
and a nice hot cider for monica . 
aw, thank you . 
rach . 
yeah . 
why does my cinnamon stick have an eraser . 
oh . 
oh, heh . 
that's why . 
sorry . 
chandler . 
miss tedlock, you're looking lovely today . 
may i say that is a very flattering sleeve length on you . 
yes . 
well, mr. costilick would like you to stop by his office at the end of the day . 
oh, listen, if this is about those prank memos, i had nothing to do with them . 
really, nothing at all. really . 
nothing . 
hey, you guys. you guys . 
chandler's coming, and he says he has this incredible news . 
so when he gets here, let's all act like, you kno . 
hey.  hey . 
never mind. but it was gonna be really good . 
what's going on?  what's up . 
it's a typical day at work. i'm inputting my numbers and big al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor . 
that is great . 
congratulations . 
so i quit . 
why . 
why? this was supposed to be a temp job . 
yeah, chandler, you've been there for five years . 
i know, but if i took it this it'd be like admitting that this is what i actually do . 
so was it a lot more money . 
doesn't matter. i just don't want to be one of those guys 00 at night worrying about the wenus . 
the wenus" . 
weekly estimated net usage system. it's a processing term . 
oh, that wenus . 
so, what are you gonna do . 
i don't know. that's the thing. i don't know . 
i'm not gonna figure it out working there . 
oh! i have something you can do . 
i have this new massage client. steve . 
anyway, um, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef . 
um, hi there . 
hi . 
oh, yeah, i know. you're a chef, i know, and i thought of you first . 
but, um, chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so yeah, i just don't have a lot of chefing experience . 
unless it's an all-toast restaurant . 
yeah. yeah . 
well, what kind of food is he looking for . 
he wants to do something eclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu . 
oh, my god . 
yeah, i know . 
so, what do you think . 
thanks, pheeb. i just don't really see myself in a big white hat . 
okay . 
oh, monica. guess what . 
can you see my nipples through this shirt . 
no, but don't worry. i'm sure they're still there . 
where you going, mr. suit-ey man . 
well, i have an appointment to see dr. robert pilman career counselor-a-go-go . 
i added the "a-go-go. . 
career counselor . 
hey, you guys all know what you want to do . 
i don't . 
hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do . 
you know, you have goals. you have dreams . 
i don't have a dream . 
ah, the lesser known "i don't have a dream" speech . 
oh, i love my life. i love my life . 
brian's song . 
the meeting with that guy went great . 
so great. he showed me where the restaurant's gonna be . 
it's this cute little place on 10th street . 
it's not too big, not too small. it's just right . 
was it formerly owned by a blond woman and some bears . 
so anyway, i'm cooking dinner for him monday night. kind of like an audition . 
and phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me . 
because you can make yummy noises . 
what are you gonna make . 
yummy noises . 
and, monica, what are you gonna make . 
i don't know. i don't know. it's just gotta be so great . 
oh! i know what you can make. i know . 
oh, you should make that thing, you know, with the stuff . 
you know that thing with the stuff . 
okay, i don't know . 
hey, guys, anyone know a good date place in the neighborhood . 
uh, how about tony's? if you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free . 
okay. ahem . 
hey, does anyone know a good place if you're not dating a puma . 
who are you going out with . 
oh, is this the bug lady . 
her name is celia. she's not a bug lady . 
she's curator of insects at the museum . 
so, what are you guys gonna do . 
well, i just thought we'd go to dinner, then bring her back to my place and i'd introduce her to my monkey . 
and he's not speaking metaphorically . 
so back to your place . 
uh-huh . 
you thinking maybe, heh-heh . 
ahem, well, i don't know, heh-heh . 
i'm hoping heh-heh . 
i'm telling you, that monkey's a chick magnet . 
she's gonna one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal . 
aah!  celia, don't worry . 
celia, he's not gonna hurt you. soothing tones, celia, soothing tones . 
okay, i'm sorry, i'm sorry .

it's creamier . 
yeah? well, is that better . 
i don't know. we're talking about whipped fish, monica . 
i'm just happy i'm keeping it down, you know . 
god, what happened to you . 
eight and a half hours of aptitude tests intelligence tests, personality tests, and what do i learn . 
you're ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multi-national corporation. . 
that's so great, because you already know how to do that . 
can you believe it . 
don't i seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool . 
you know, i just always pictured myself doing somethin . 
something . 
oh, chandler, i know, i know . 
oh, hey, you can see your nipples through this shirt . 
here you go. maybe this will cheer you up . 
ooh, you know, um, i had a grape about five hours ago so i better split this with you . 
it's supposed to be that small. it's a pre-appetizer . 
the french call it an amuse-bouche . 
well, it is amusing . 
hello? oh, hi, wendy . 
yeah, 8:00 . 
what did we say? ten dollars an hour .

bu . 
but, but . 
but, you see, it's just this night has to go just perfect, you know and, well, wendy's more of a professional waitress . 
oh . 
i see. yes. and i've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that i can waitress in the olympics . 
you know, i don't mean to brag, but i waited tables at innsbruck in '76 .

whoa, you cuddled? how many times . 
shut up. it was nice. i just i just don't think i'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know . 
what's the big deal? just say what you want to do to her .

rach, take down the lights," and put it on the refriger . 
how long has that been there .

i'm supposed to be the mommy . 
okay, i'm gonna play my sperm card one more time . 
i don't see why i have to miss out on the coaching training because i'm a woman . 
i see. so, what do you propose to do . 
i'll flip you for it . 
flip me for it? no, no, no . 
heads, heads, heads . 
on your back, mom .

bath salts would be nice . 
oh, okay. good . 
what is this place . 
look, you're cold, i have to pee, and there's coffee . 
how bad could it be . 
i think we have an answer . 
what's she doing here . 
this could be god's way of telling us to eat at home . 
think she got fired at riff's . 
no, we were there last night . 
she kept bringing swordfish. are you gonna go . 
i'll wait until we order. it's her, right .

so you're here too . 
as much as you are . 
your turn . 
we know what we want . 
oh, that's good . 
all we want is two caffe lattes . 
and some biscotti cookies . 
good choice . 
it's definitely her . 
yeah . 
i can't believe you . 
you still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet . 
well, you still haven't taken down the christmas lights . 
congratulations. i think you found the world's thinnest argument . 
i'm just trying to find the right moment . 
oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating . 
sweetheart, you're fired. but how about a quickie before i go to work? . 
hey . 
hey . 
once you're inside, you don't have to knock anymore . 
i'll get it . 
oh. hi, mr. heckles . 
you're doing it again . 
we're not doing anything . 
we're just sitting around talking quietly . 
i can hear you through the ceiling . 
my cats can't sleep . 
you don't even have cats . 
i could have cats . 
goodbye, mr. heckles . 
we'll try to keep it down . 
phoebe, can you do me a favor . 
try this on to make sure it fits . 
oh, my first birthday present. oh, this is really oh, no, no. it's for ursula. i just figured, you know, size-wise . 
oh. sure. yeah . 
okay, it fits .

yep, ice capades . 
wow, this is serious . 
i've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade . 
i don't know. i like her . 
she's different. there's, uh, something about her that you like. we get it. you like her. great . 
hey, phoebe, i asked you, and you said it was okay . 
well, maybe now it's not okay .

well, maybe now i'm not okay with it not being okay . 
okay . 
knit, good woman. knit. knit . 
and that's the chrysler building right there . 
oh . 
nina . 
mr. douglas . 
cool tie . 
she's still here . 
yes. yes, she is . 
didn't i memo you on this . 
see, after i let her go, uh, i got a call from her psychiatrist, dr. flanen dr. flanan, dr. flan . 
and, uh, he informed me that she took the news rather badly . 
in fact, he, uh, mentioned the word "frenzy. . 
you're kidding. she seems s . 
oh, no, no. nina? she's . 
in fact, if you asked her now she'd have no recollection of being fired at all . 
that's unbelievable . 
and yet believable . 
so i decided not to fire her again until i'm sure she will be of no threat to herself or others . 
i see. hmm. you never really know what's going on inside a person's head . 
well, i guess that's why they call it psychology, sir . 
the sound mom and dad will never forget . 
for this, after all, is the miracle of birth . 
lights, please . 
and that's having a baby . 
next week is our final class . 
susan, go deep . 
it's impossible. it's just impossible . 
what is, honey . 
what that woman did . 
i am not doing that. heh . 
it'll have to stay in, that's all. everything will be the same . 
it'll just stay in. ha, ha . 
carol, honey. shh . 
everything will be all right . 
what do you know . 
no one's saying to you, "hi, is that your nostril . 
mind if we push this pot roast through it? . 
carol, sweetie . 
cleansing breath . 
i know it's frightening. . 
the birth part is just one day and when it's over, we'll all be parents for the rest of our lives . 
i mean, that's what this is all about, right . 
ross . 
ross . 
i'm gonna be a father . 
this is just occurring to you . 
i always knew i was having a baby . 
i just never realized the baby was having me . 
oh, you're gonna be great . 
how could you say that .

you meant sex, right . 
do you have a sec . 
uh, sure, nina. what's up . 
i don't know. for the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks . 
oh, well, uh, maybe that's because they're, uh, jealous of us . 
maybe . 
but that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors . 
uh, well, maybe that's, uh, because you're getting a big raise . 
i am . 
sure. why not . 
oh, my god. you're amazing . 
oh, you don't know . 
helen, make sure we put through the paperwork on miss bookbinder's raise .

ooh. how'd she take it . 
pretty well. except for the stapler thing . 
little tip. if you're ever in a similar situation never, ever leave your hand on the desk . 
okay, i think i get how to do this . 
can we turn this off? can we make them go away . 
because i can't watch .

yep, that's me. heh. i am that stupid . 
i had a dream last night where i was playing football with my kid . 
that's nice . 
that's nice . 
no, no. with him . 
i'm on this field, and they hike me the baby . 
i know i've gotta do something because the tampa bay defense is coming right at me . 
tampa bay's got a terrible team . 
right, but it is just me and the baby, so i'm thinking they can take us . 
and so i, uh, he . 
i just heave it downfield . 
what are you, crazy? that's a baby . 
he should take the sack . 
anyway, suddenly i'm downfield . 
and i realize that i'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right . 
only i know there's no way i'm not gonna get there in time . 
so i am running and i'm running and that is when i woke up . 
see, i am so not ready to be a father . 
hey, you're gonna be fine . 
you're one of the most caring, responsible men in north america . 
you're gonna make a great dad . 
yeah, ross. you and the baby just need better blocking . 
oh. have either of you ever been to the rainbow room? is it expensive . 
only if you order stuff . 
i'm taking ursula tonight. it's her birthday . 
whoa. what about phoebe's birthday . 
when's that . 
uh tonight . 
ugh, man, what are the odds of that happening . 
you take your time . 
there it is . 
so, what are you gonna do . 
what can i do? i don't want to screw it up with ursula . 
and your friend phoebe . 
if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. wouldn't you guys . 
man, if you tried that on my birthday you'd be staring at the business end of a hissy fit . 
you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference . 
okay, u . 
monica . 
yes . 
yes, she is . 
hi. this is my friend rachel .

young to be a doctor . 
oh, good, rach . 
thank you . 
right . 
so he said it was just a sprain, and that was it . 
uh, you left out the stupid part . 
it's not stupid . 
the very cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and i said yes . 
i think it's totally insane. i mean, they work for the hospital . 
it's like returning to the scene of the crime . 
i say we blow off the dates . 
what? monica, they are cute . 
they are doctors. cute doctors. doctors who are cute . 
all right, what have we learned so far . 
surprise .

everybody i love is in the same room . 
where's joey .

i tell you, i wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried-tomato business . 
five years ago, if somebody'd said to me, "here's a tomato that looks like a prune" i'd have said, "get out of my office. . 
dad, before i was born, did you freak out at all . 
i'm not freaking out. i'm just saying if someone had come to me with the idea dad, dad, dad. i'm talking about the whole, uh, baby thing . 
did you, uh, ever get this sort of panicky, "oh, my god, i'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing . 
no . 
your mother really did the work. i was busy with the business . 
i wasn't around that much . 
is that what this is about . 
no, no, dad. i was just wondering . 
there's time to make up for that. we can do stuff together . 
you always wanted to go to colonial williamsburg. how about we do that . 
thanks, dad. really, heh . 
you know, i just, i just i just needed to know, um when did you start to feel like a father . 
oh. well, i guess it must have been the day after you were born . 
we were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep and they brought you in and gave you to me . 
you were this ugly little red thing . 
and all of a sudden, you grabbed my finger with your whole fist and you squeezed it so tight . 
and that's when i knew . 
so you don't want to go to williamsburg . 
we can go to williamsburg . 
eat your fish . 
rachel, the cute doctors are here . 
okay, coming . 
hi, come on in. hey, michael, jeffrey .

i mean, i think it'll be fine . 
it will not. we'll get in trouble . 
monica, would you stop being such a wuss . 
a wuss? excuse me for living in the real world . 
so . 
so they still seem normal . 
that's because they are . 
you have to admit, when we go out with women we meet at the hospital would you relax? take a look around . 
there are no pagan altars . 
no piles of bones in the corners . 
they're fine. go like this . 
i said we are not going to do it, okay? sometimes you can be such a big baby . 
i am not a baby .

so, monica, what do you do . 
uh, i am a, uh, chef at a restaurant uptown .

thank you . 
we were playing poker, right . 
there was chocolate on the three. it looked like an eight, all right . 
oh, god, you should've seen him. "read them and weep. . 
and then he did . 
well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us . 
yeah, what is that? like some kind of guy thing . 
like some kind of sexist guy thing . 
like, it's poker, so only guys can play . 
no. women are welcome to play . 
oh, okay, so then what is it . 
some kind of, you know, like, some kind of, you know, lik . 
all right, what is it . 
there just don't happen to be any women in our game . 
yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker . 
oh, please. that is such a lame excuse. i mean, it's a typical guy response . 
excuse me, do any of you know how to play . 
but you could teach us . 
okay, so now we draw cards . 
so i wouldn't need any, right? because i have a straight . 
oh, good for you . 
congratulations . 
okay, pheebs, how many do you want . 
okay, i just need two. the 10 of spades and the six of clubs . 
no, uh, pheebs, you can't do that . 
i have the 10 of spades. here, you want it . 
thanks . 
uh, no, see, uh, you can't do that . 
no, no. that's okay. i don't need them. i'm going for fours . 
oh, you'r . 
all right, here we go . 
we've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudités . 
whoa, whoa, whoa. monica, what are you doing . 
this is a poker game. you can't serve food with more than one syllable . 
it's got to be like chips or dip or pretz okay, so at this point, the dealer you know what? we got it. we got it. let's play for real. high stakes. big bucks . 
all right, now, you sure? phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy . 
but i'm ready. so just deal . 
okay, all right, last minute lesson. last minute lesson. joey . 
three eight . 
eight, three. all right. here we go . 
damn it, damn it, damn it . 
i see. so then, um, you were lying . 
about what . 
about how good your cards were . 
heh. i was bluffing . 
aha. and what is "bluffing" . 
is it not another word for lying . 
okay, sorry to break up this party but i've got résumés to fax before work tomorrow . 
whoa, whoa, whoa . 
rach, we've got to settle . 
settle what . 
the jamestown colony of virginia . 
you see, king george is giving us the land, so the game, rachel. the game. you owe us money for the game . 
oh, right . 
you know what, guys? it's their first time. why don't we forget about the money . 
hell, no. we'll pay . 
okay, monica, i had another answer all ready . 
and you know what . 
we want a rematch . 
well, that's fine with me . 
could use the money . 
so, basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends . 
yeah . 
yes, and i get my ya-yas from lkea . 
you have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less . 
look, rachel, this is poker. i play to win, all right . 
in order for me to win, other people have to lose . 
so if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a nice guy . 
okay, because once those cards are deal . 
yeah . 
i'm not a nice guy . 
all right, boys. let's eat . 
ah, did you get that from the "i love rachel" pizzeria . 
you still on that . 
come on . 
what was with that whole black bart speech . 
when i play poker, i'm not a nice guy" . 
you're way off, pal . 
no, i don't think so. see, ross, because i think you love her . 
uh, no . 
see, i might have had feelings for her at one time. not anymore . 
i just marcel . 
where are you going with that disk? you are not putting that on again . 
marcel okay. if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble . 
you believe what a jerk ross was being . 
yeah, i know. he can get really competitive . 
what . 
oh. "hello, kettle, this is monica. you're black. . 
please . 
i am not as bad as ross . 
oh, i beg to differ. the pictionary incident . 
that was not an incident . 
i was gesturing and the plate slipped out of my hand . 
oh . 
oh! i got an interview. i got an interview . 
you're kidding. where? where . 
saks fifth avenue . 
oh, rachel . 
oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home . 
well, what's the job . 
assistant buyer . 
oh! i would be shopping for a living . 
okay, look. that's aunt iris . 
this woman has been playing poker since she was 5 . 
you've gotta listen to every word she says . 
hi . 
is tony randall dead . 
oh, why . 
i don't think so . 
well, he may be now because i think i hit him with my car . 
my god. really . 
no, that's bluffing. lesson number one . 
let me tell you something . 
everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap . 
nice earrings . 
thank you . 
girls, sit down . 
um, aunt iris, this is phoebe, and rache . 
yeah, yeah, yeah . 
listen, i am parked at a meter. let's do it . 
ross, could we please, please, listen to anything else . 
all right . 
i'm gonna pay for that tonight . 
hi . 
hey . 
guess what, guess what, guess what . 
uh, okay. the fifth dentist caved, and now they're all recommending trident . 
no, the interview . 
she loved me. she absolutely loved me . 
we talked for, like, two and a half hours. we have the same taste in clothes . 
oh, i went to camp with her cousin . 
and, oh, the job is perfect. i can do this. i can do this well . 
that's great . 
god. and she told the funniest story . 
okay, great, you'll tell us and we'll laugh . 
let's play poker . 
all right, listen, we talked about it and if you don't want to play, we completely understand . 
yes, yes. we can play some other game. like, i don't know pictionary . 
very funny. very funny . 
i think we'd like to give poker another try. shall we, ladies . 
yes, i think we should . 
rach, do you want me to shuffle those . 
no, no. that's okay. you know what? i'm gonna give it a go . 
all right . 
all right . 
so pheebs owes 7.50. monica, you owe $10 . 
and, rachel, you owe 15 big ones . 
thanks for teaching us "crossed-eyed mary. . 
you guys, we gotta play that other way . 
all right, here's my 7.50, but i think you should know that this money is cursed . 
what . 
oh, i cursed it . 
so now bad things will happen to he who spends it . 
that's all right, i'll take it. bad things happen to me anyway . 
this way, i can break them up with a movie . 
so that just leaves the big green poker machine, who owes 15 . 
hmm, oh, it's so typical . 
ooh, i'm a man. ooh, i have a penis . 
ooh, i have to win money to exert my power over women. . 
you know what? this is not over . 
we will play you again. and we will win and you will lose . 
and you will beg and we will laugh . 
and we will take every last dime you have . 
and you will hate yourselves forever . 
hmm. kind of stepped on my point there, mon . 
so you gals wanna hand over your money now . 
that way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing . 
no, that's fine. we'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy . 
okay, are we done with the chitchat? are we ready to play serious poker . 
hey, you guys, look. the one-eyed jack follows me wherever i go . 
right, okay. serious poker . 
excuse me. where are you going . 
uh, to the bathroom . 
do you wanna go to the bathroom or do you wanna play poker . 
i wanna go to the bathroom . 
all right, well, i'm gonna order a pizza . 
oh, no, no, no . 
i'm waiting to hear from that job . 
and the store closes at 9, so you can eat then . 
that's fine. i'll just have a tic tac to hold me over .

i guess it's not about no guys . 
it's about the right guy, you know . 
hmm . 
with barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat . 
mm . 
you know, with paolo that's all there was, was heat . 
and i mean, it was just this raw, animal, sexua . 
right, right. i got it . 
i was there . 
i mean, do you think you can ever have both . 
you know? someone who's like your best friend but then also can make your toes curl . 
yes, yes . 
yes. yes, i do. i really do . 
uh, in fact, it's funny . 
very often, someone who you wouldn't think could curl your toes might just be the one wh . 
hi . 
 gets interrupted. hi . 
hey, guys, how was the movie . 
oh, so wonderful . 
oh, it was so good . 
suck fest . 
total chick flick . 
i'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, you know, like, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast . 
hey, i don't need violence to enjoy a movie just so long as there's a little nudity . 
there was nudity . 
i meant female nudity . 
all right, i don't need to see lou grant frolicking . 
hugh. hugh grant . 
all right, i've got to go. ahem . 
come on, marcel. come on . 
yeah, we're gonna go take a bath. yes, we are, aren't we? yes, we are . 
they're still just friends, right . 
and i will see you tomorrow . 
that's right. you're gonna spend tomorrow at aunt rachel's, aren't you . 
hang on, hang on. does aunt monica get a say in this . 
please, aunt monica, please? ha, ha . 
oh, unclench. you're not even gonna be here . 
i can't believe we're having this discussion . 
i agree. i'm, like, in disbelief . 
don't you think if things were gonna happen with rachel, they would've happened . 
i'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me . 
she really said that . 
well, i added the "exactly like me" part . 
but she said she's looking for someone. and someone is gonna be there tonight . 
tonight" tonight . 
well, i think it's perfect. it's just gonna be the two of us . 
she spent all day taking care of my monkey . 
i can't remember the last time i got a girl to take care of my monkey . 
anyway, you know, i figured after work, i'd go pick up a bottle of wine go over there and, uh, try to woo her . 
hey, you know what you should do . 
you should take her back to the 1890s when that phrase was last used . 
if you keep this up you'll be finished with this sucker by the end of the week . 
now, the one in the feathered boa, that's dr. francis . 
now, she used to be a man . 
oh, look. see, now, there's raven. we hate her . 
we're glad she's dying . 
and then what? marcel . 
are you playing with monica's shoes? you know you're not supposed t . 
whoa, whoa . 
marcel, did you poo in the shoe . 
oh, marcel. bad monkey . 
oh, god . 
oh . 
sorry, barry . 
a little engagement gift . 
i'm sure you didn't register for that . 
who died? who died . 
roll him over. oh, come on, roll him over. oh . 
well, we know it wasn't dexter, right, marcel? becaus . 
marcel? marcel? marc .

i don't know, i don't know . 
we were watching tv, and then he pooped in monica's shoe wait. he pooped in my shoe? which one . 
i don't know. the left one . 
which ones . 
oh, those little clunky amish things you think go with everything . 
hey.  hey . 
whoa, oh. why is the air in here so negative . 
rachel lost marcel . 
oh, no. how . 
he pooped in my shoe . 
which one . 
those cute little black ones i wear all the time . 
no, which one? ha, ha . 
the right or left . 
because the left one is lucky . 
come on, you guys. what am i gonna do . 
all right, all right, all right. you're a monkey you're loose in the city . 
where do you go . 
okay, it's his first time out so he's probably gonna want to do some of the touristy things . 
i'll go to cats. you go to the russian tea room . 
oh, my god! come on, you guys . 
he's gonna be home any minute. he's gonna kill me . 
start with the building. you take the first and second floor . 
phoebe and i will take third and fourth . 
whoa, whoa. what am i gonna do . 
okay, you stay here and just wait by the phone . 
spray lysol in my shoe and wait for ross to kill you . 
does anybody want to trade . 
what do you want . 
mr. heckles, our friend lost a monkey. have you seen it . 
i left a belgian waffle out here. did you take it . 
no . 
why would you leave your belgian waffle in the hall . 
i wasn't ready for it . 
the monkey, have you seen a monkey . 
i saw regis philbin once . 
thank you, mr. heckles . 
you owe me a waffle . 
okay, he's a black capuchin monkey with a white face with russian dressing and pickles on the side . 
okay, thanks . 
hi . 
hey. how did it go today . 
oh, great. it went great. really great . 
yeah . 
hey, is that wine . 
yeah. yeah . 
you, uh, want some . 
oh, i would love some . 
yeah . 
but you know what? you know what? let's not drink it here . 
i'm feeling kind of crazy. do you want to go to newark . 
uh, okay. yeah . 
we could do that. but before we head off to the murder capital of the northeast i was, uh, kind of wanted to run something by you . 
you know how we were, you know, talking before about relationships and stuff, wel . 
oh, god, ross, i cannot do this . 
okay, quick and painful . 
oh, god . 
okay, all right. all right, okay . 
ross, please don't hate me . 
oh, what? what? what . 
you know marcel . 
yeah . 
well, ahem . 
i kind of, uh i kind of lost him . 
i can't believe this . 
i mean, all i asked you to do was keep him in the apartment . 
i know, i know. i'm sorry . 
you know what? i guess it's partially my fault . 
i shouldn't have asked you to start off with a monkey . 
i should have started you off with, like, a pen or a pencil . 
ross, i'm doing everything that i can . 
i've got everybody looking for him and i go . 
who is it?  animal control . 
see, i've even got animal control . 
you called animal control . 
uh-huh . 
why? do you not like them . 
heh. marcel is an illegal exotic animal . 
i'm not allowed to have him in the city . 
if they find him, they'll take him away from me . 
okay, well, now, see, you never ever, ever told us that . 
that's right, because i didn't expect you we're gonna invite them to the apartment . 
hi. thanks for coming . 
somebody called about a monkey . 
oh. oh, you know what? that was a complete misunderstanding . 
yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we didn't . 
it turned out it was a hat . 
cat . 
cat. what did i say . 
hi. we checked the third and fourth floor . 
no one's seen marcel . 
marcel . 
my uncle marcel . 
oh, is that who the monkey's named after . 
okay . 
are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal . 
oh, my god . 
you'd put that poor little creature in jail . 
pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first . 
yes, but there isn't always time . 
look, i'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this. um, have a seat . 
first of all, we haven't been introduced. i'm monica geller . 
oh, my god, you are . 
and you're rachel green . 
yeah . 
luisa gianetti. lincoln high . 
i sat behind you guys in homeroom . 
oh! luisa. oh, my god . 
monica. it's luisa . 
luisa. from homeroom . 
yes . 
you have no idea who i am, do you?  no . 
not at all . 
well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me . 
would it have been so hard to say, "morning, luisa" or "nice overalls" . 
oh, i'm so sorry . 
it's not so much you. you were fat. you had your own problems . 
but you. what a bitch . 
what . 
you know what? be that as it may . 
you think you could you help us out here on that monkey thing, for old times' sake . 
go, bobcats . 
i could. but i won't . 
if i find that monkey, he's mine . 
sorry . 
marcel . 
marcel . 
marcel . 
marcel . 
hi, can i help you . 
uh, we're kind of having an emergency, and, ahem, we were looking for something . 
a monkey . 
yes, have you seen any . 
no. no, i haven't seen a monkey . 
do you know anything about fixing radiators . 
sure, sure. did you try turning the knob back the other way . 
of course . 
oh. then, no . 
taste this daiquiri. is there too much rum in here . 
just a second. hope you find your monkey . 
oh, no, wait. no, no, no. wait, wait . 
um, we may not know about radiators, per se but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling milieu . 
uh, weren't we kind of in the middle of something here . 
yes, but these women are very hot and they need our help . 
and they're very hot . 
we can't, all right . 
we're sorry . 
you have no idea how sorry. but we promised we'd find this monkey . 
if you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name marcel . 
so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out . 
okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people . 
marcel . 
marcel . 
marcel . 
marcel . 
oh, my god . 
what . 
something just brushed up against my right leg . 
what is it . 
oh . 
oh, it's okay. it was just my left leg . 
look, phoebe . 
oh, yeah. oh, marcel. come here . 
oh, come here, marcel . 
step aside, ladies . 
what are you gonna do . 
just a small tranquilizer . 
run, marcel, run! run, marcel . 
damn . 
are you okay . 
oh, yeah, i think so . 
oh . 
huh . 
whoa . 
oh, gosh . 
marcel. marcel . 
this is ridiculous. we've been all over the neighborhood . 
he's gone. he's just gone . 
ross, you don't know that . 
oh, come on. it's cold, it's dark . 
he doesn't know the village . 
and now i have a broken foot. oh, m . 
i have no monkey and a broken foot . 
thank you very much . 
ross, you know, i've said i'm sorry, like, a million times . 
what do you want me to do? huh? you want me to break my foot too . 
here, i'm gonna break my foot right now. ow . 
oh, my god. there, are you happy now . 
yeah, yeah. you know, now that you kicked the sign hey, ha, ha, i don't miss marcel anymore . 
you know, it's not like i did this on purpose . 
no, no, no. no, no. this is just vintage rachel . 
i mean, things just sort of happen around you . 
i mean, you're off in rachel land, doing your rachel thing totally oblivious to people's monkeys or to people's feelings an . 
i don't even want to hear it . 
ross . 
forget it, okay . 
ross . 
what? what . 
hey, banana man . 
oh, this is so intense . 
one side of my butt is totally asleep and the other side has no idea . 
hi. did you order some bananas . 
what about it . 
give me my monkey back . 
i don't have a monkey . 
then what's with all the bananas . 
potassium . 
marcel? marcel . 
okay, where is he? where is he? marcel? marcel . 
marcel . 
what have you done to him . 
that's my monkey. that's patty. patty the monkey . 
are you insane . 
come here, marcel. come on . 
come here, patty . 
come here, marcel . 
come here, patty . 
here, monkey. here, monkey. here, monkey . 
gotcha . 
okay, give me my monkey back . 
that's my monkey . 
you're gonna have to take this up with the judge . 
that's not my monkey. just the dress is mine . 
you can send it back whenever . 
all right, i want my monkey . 
no . 
oh, come on, luisa . 
sorry, prom queen . 
you had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't have been fat . 
all right, look, in high school, i was the prom queen and i was the homecoming queen and the class president and you were also there . 
look, if you take this monkey i will lose one of the most important people in my life . 
you can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him . 
come on, luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here . 
take it . 
no . 
all right . 
well, then how about i call your supervisor and i tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart . 
hey, it'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it . 
or we can leave it on for now. that's fine . 
you know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit . 
listen i'm sorry i was so hard on you before. you know, i just no, ross, come on. no, no. it was my fault. i almost lost your no, no. yeah, but you were the one who got him back . 
you know, you were great . 
hey, we still have that bottle of wine . 
are you in the mood for, uh something grape . 
sure, that would be good . 
all right, u . 
oh . 
the, uh the neighbors must be vacuuming . 
well, ah, as long as we're here and not on the subject, um, ahem i was thinking about, uh how mad we got at each other before . 
and, um, i was thinking maybe it was partially because of how w . 
rachel . 
barry . 
i can't. i can't do it. i can't marry mindy . 
i'm still in love with you . 
oh . 
we have got to start locking that door . 
this is me in the sound of music . 
you see the von trapp kids . 
no . 
that's because i'm in front of them . 
yeah, i thought that was an alp . 
well, high school was not my favorite time . 
i don't know. i loved high school, you know . 
it was just, like, four years of parties and dating and sex and yeah, well, i went to boarding school with 400 boys . 
any sex i had would've involved a major lifestyle choice . 
gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago . 
oh, oh, oh . 
oh, my butt cheek is waking up . 
i can't believe you would actually say that . 
i would much rather be mr. peanut than mr. salty . 
no way. mr. salty is a sailor, all right . 
he's gotta be, like, the toughest snack there is . 
i don't know. you don't wanna mess with corn nuts . 
they're crazy . 
oh, my god. oh, my god. you gotta come see this . 
there's some creep out there with a telescope . 
i can't believe it. he's looking right at us . 
oh, that is so sick . 
i feel violated . 
and not in a good way . 
how can people do that . 
oh, you guys, look. ugly naked guy got gravity boots . 
i'm telling you, years from now, school children will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time . 
it was unbelievable . 
we could totally be ourselves. we didn't have to play any games . 
so have you called her yet . 
let her know i like her? are you insane . 
guys. it's gross . 
it's the next day. how needy do i wanna seem . 
i'm right. right . 
let her dangle . 
yeah, definitely . 
oh . 
i can't believe my parents are pressuring me to find one of you people . 
god. come on. just do it . 
call her. stop being so testosterone-y . 
which, by the way, is the real san francisco treat . 
i got her machine . 
her answering machine . 
no, interestingly enough, her leaf blower picked up . 
so, um, why didn't you say anything . 
oh, no, no, no. last time i left a spontaneous message i ended up using the phrase, "yes, indeed-io. . 
look, it's rachel and barry. no, no, don't everybody look at once . 
okay, okay. what's going on . 
okay, they're just talking . 
yeah, well, does he look upset . 
does he look like he was just told to shove anything . 
no. no, actually, he's smiling . 
oh, my god. don't do that . 
what? what? what . 
that man across the street just kicked that pigeon . 
oh . 
and basically, that's how a bill becomes a law . 
oh . 
see? hey, rach . 
hey . 
how'd it go . 
you know, it was, uh it was actually really great . 
took me to lunch at the russian tea room . 
i had that chicken, you know, where you poke it and butter squirts out . 
not a good day for birds . 
and then we took a walk to bendel's . 
and i told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of chanel . 
that's nice. now was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, huh . 
right. well, we never actually got to that . 
oh, it was just so nice to see him again, you know? it wa . 
it was comfortable and it was familiar . 
it was just nice . 
that's "nice" twice . 
rachel, what's going on . 
isn't this the same barry who you left at the altar . 
duh. where have you been . 
yeah, but it was different with him today . 
he wasn't, like, orthodontist guy, you know . 
i mean, we had fun. is there anything wrong with that . 
yes . 
why . 
i have my reasons . 
okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman who just happens to be your ex-best friend . 
all right. all right, all right, all right. i know it's stupid . 
i'll go see him this afternoon and i will just put an end to it . 
wow . 
wow . 
ha, ha . 
yeah . 
i'm not crazy, right? i mean, it was never like that . 
no, it wasn't . 
oh. it was so nice having this little sink here . 
oh, danielle, i wasn't expecting the machine . 
give me a call when you get a chance. . 
bye-bye . 
oh, god . 
that's what you've been working on for the past two hours . 
hey, i've been honing . 
what was with the dishes . 
oh, uh, i wanted her to think i might be in a restaurant you know, i might have some kind of life . 
like i haven't been sitting around here honing for the last two hours . 
he's doing it again. the guy with the telescope . 
oh, my god . 
oh. go away. stop looking in here . 
great. now he's waving back . 
we gotta do something about that guy . 
this morning, i caught him looking into our apartment . 
it creeps me out. i feel like i can't do stuff . 
what kind of stuff . 
will you grow up? i'm not talking about sexy stuff but, like, when i'm cooking naked . 
you cook naked . 
yeah, toast, oatmeal. nothing that spatters . 
what are you looking at me for? i didn't know that . 
what's the matter . 
oh, i just oh, barry, this was not good . 
no, it was. it was very, very good . 
what about mindy . 
oh, way better than mindy . 
no, not that. i mean, what about you and mindy . 
oh. if you want, i'll just break it off with her . 
no. no, no, no . 
no, don't do that. not for me . 
dr. farber, bobby rush is here for his adjustment . 
thanks, bernice . 
let's go away this weekend . 
oh, barry. come on. this is all way to . 
no, we can go to aruba . 
when i went there on what would've been our honeymoon it was, uh it was really nice. you would've liked it . 
i had a bra . 
hey, dr. farber . 
all right, miss green, everything looks fine . 
yep, i think we're starting to see some real progress here . 
what . 
i'm 12, i'm not stupid . 
can i use your phone . 
yeah . 
uh, but for future reference, um, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone . 
yes, it's working . 
why isn't she calling me back . 
maybe she never got your message . 
you know, you could call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps that means she probably didn't get her messages yet . 
you don't think that makes me seem . 
desperate? needy? pathetic . 
ah, you obviously saw my personal ad . 
how many beeps . 
she answered . 
you see, this is where you'd use that "hello" word we talked about . 
i'm not going to. she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. now i'm needy and snubbed . 
god, i miss just being needy . 
hey . 
so how'd he take it . 
pretty well, actually . 
uh, rach. how come you have dental floss in your hair . 
oh, do i . 
we ended up having sex in his chair . 
you had sex in his chair . 
i said that a little too loudly, didn't i . 
you had what . 
sex in his chair . 
what . 
what were you thinking . 
i don't know. i mean, we still care about each other . 
there's a history there. it's like you and carol . 
no. no, no . 
it's nothing like me and carol . 
please. if she said to you, "ross, i want you on this couch right here, right now," what would you say . 
if it helps i could slide over . 
it's a totally different situation . 
it's apples and oranges. it's orthodontists and lesbian . 
i gotta go . 
where are you going . 
i just have to go, all right . 
do i need a reason, huh? i have things to do with my life . 
i have a jam-packed schedule . 
and i am late for keeping up with it, okay . 
hello? hello . 
hello . 
huh. mindy . 
hi. hey, how are you . 
yes, yes, i heard. congratulations. that is so great .

hell is filled with people like you .

please, i haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me . 
i mean, what else is it about . 
she was my best friend, you guys . 
we went to camp together she taught me how to kis . 
yeah . 
now, you know, i'm, like, the other woman . 
ugh, i feel s . 
naughty . 
i'll see you guys later . 
i'll walk out with you . 
when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp and were you wearing any kind of little uniform or . 
that's fine, yeah . 
okay, i'm gonna go the bathroom. will you watch my phone . 
why don't you just take it with you . 
hey . 
we haven't been on a second date. she needs to hear me pee . 
why don't you just call her . 
i can't call her. i left a message. i have some pride . 
do you . 
no . 
danielle, hi . 
hi, it's chandler . 
i'm fine. ahem . 
uh, listen i don't know if you tried to call me because, uh, idiot that i am i accidentally shut off my phone .

so, what's up . 
um, we should really be sitting for this . 
hmm . 
sure we should . 
s . 
now, i know things have been weird lately . 
but you're my oldest friend, except for laurie schaefer who i don't talk to anymore because she's bitter that she lost the weight and it turns out, she doesn't have a pretty face . 
okay, i'm gonna just ask you this once, and i want a straight answer . 
okay . 
will you be my maid of honor . 
of course . 
oh, that's so great .

is that all you wanted to ask . 
that's all . 
what? what . 
that's not all . 
oh, sure it is . 
oh, no, it isn't. no . 
i think barry's seeing someone in the city . 
what would make you think that . 
well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's acted weird . 
and then last night, he came home smelling like chanel . 
really . 
mindy, if it'll make you feel any better when barry and i got engaged, he went through a weird thing too . 
oh, god. you see, that's what i was afraid of . 
what? what's what you were afraid of . 
okay, okay . 
when barry was engaged to you, he and i kind of had a little thing on the side . 
what . 
i know, i know . 
when he proposed to me, everyone said, "don't do it . 
he's gonna do to you what he did to rachel." and now i feel so stupid . 
ha, ha . 
hmm. oh, mindy . 
oh, you are so stupid . 
oh, we are both so stupid . 
what do you mean . 
smell familiar?  oh, no . 
mm-hm .

i tried to call you from the coffee shop. there was no answer . 
i turned it off . 
mother of god, i turned it off .

just pointing out the irony . 
so listen, i went across the street and talked to the doorman . 
i got the peeper's name. can i use the phone .

mindy . 
mindy, of course, mindy. it was always mindy . 
even when we were having sex in that chair . 
i swear, look, whatever i was doing, i was always thinking of you . 
oh, please . 
during that second time, you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup . 
you did it twice . 
well, the first time didn't really count. you know, it was barry . 
oh, right . 
honey, baby, sweetheart, loo . 
just give me another chance, okay . 
we'll start all over again. we'll go back to aruba .

look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay . 
i'll be right back . 
okay . 
okay, and we'll be here, hating you . 
see how he was sweating when he walked out of here . 
if i'm hogging the ball, you jump right in there and take a couple of punches. because i'm telling you, this feels great . 
yeah, i'm pretty sure i'm still gonna marry him . 
what are you talking about . 
mindy, the guy is the devil . 
he is satan in a smock . 
look, i know he's not perfect . 
but the truth is, at the end of the day i still really wanna be mrs. dr. barry farber d.d.s . 
oh, god . 
i hope you can find some way to be happy for me . 
and i hope you'll still be my maid of honor . 
and i hope barry doesn't kill you and eat you in aruba . 
you okay . 
yeah . 
really . 
yeah . 
you know, ever since i ran out on barry at the wedding i have wondered whether i made the right choice . 
oh. and now i know . 
i'm so glad . 
big day . 
mr. peanut is a better dresser . 
i mean, he's got the monocle, he's got the top ha . 
did you know he's gay . 
i just wanna clarify this. are you outing mr. peanut . 
chandler . 
danielle, hi . 
everybody, this is danielle. danielle, everybody . 
hi . 
what are you doing here . 
i've been calling you but it turns out i had your number wrong . 
and when i finally got the right one from information, there was no answer . 
so i thought i'd just come down here and make sure you were okay . 
oh, uh, i'm okay . 
listen, uh, maybe we could get together later . 
that sounds good. i'll call you. or you call me, whatever . 
you know . 
ha, ha . 
you got it.  okay . 
bye, everybody.  bye . 
woo-hoo! yeah, there you go . 
second date . 
i don't know . 
you don't know . 
oh, she seems nice, but that thing about her coming all the way here just to see if i was okay? i mean, how needy is that . 
how'd someone get your credit card number . 
i have no idea. look how much they spent . 
calm down. you only have to pay for the stuff you bought . 
still, it's just such reckless spending . 
when somebody steals your credit card they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind . 
wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop . 
that's me . 
oh! oh, the yuck . 
he's doing it again . 
marcel, stop humping the lamp . 
stop humping! now, marcel, come back . 
come here, marcel . 
oh, no, no! not in my room! i'll get him . 
you've got to do something about the humping . 
what? it's just a phase . 
well, that's what we said about joey . 
hey, would you all relax? it's not that big a deal . 
marcel, stop it! marcel! bad monkey . 
what?  ugh . 
let's just say my curious george doll is no longer curious . 
ugh, monica, you are not still going over that thing . 
this woman's living my life . 
what . 
she's living my life, and she's doing it better than me . 
look at this. look . 
she buys tickets to plays i want to see . 
she shops at stores that i'm intimidated by the salespeople . 
she spent $300 on art supplies . 
you're not an artist . 
yeah, well, i might be if i had the supplies . 
i mean, i could do all this stuff. only i don't . 
oh, monica, come on. you do cool things . 
oh, really? let's compare, shall we . 
oh, it's so late for "shall we? . 
do i go horseback riding in the park, hmm . 
do i take classes at the new school . 
no . 
no . 
this is so unfair . 
she's got everything i want, and she doesn't have my mother . 
how about joey paponi . 
no, still too ethnic. my agent thinks i should have a name that's more neutral . 
joey switzerland . 
plus i think it should be joe. joey makes me sound like i'm this big . 
which i'm not . 
joe, joe, joe stalin . 
stalin . 
do i know that name? that sounds familiar . 
well, it does not ring a bell with me . 
huh . 
joe stalin . 
you know, that's pretty good . 
you might want to try joseph . 
ah . 
joseph stalin . 
i think you'd remember that . 
oh, yes . 
bye bye birdie, starring joseph stalin . 
joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof . 
hey . 
hey . 
hi . 
hi. uh, yes, this is monica geller . 
um, i'm taking classes with you, and i was wondering what they were . 
what are you doing . 
all right, great . 
great. thanks a lot . 
i'm going to tap class . 
so you can dance with the woman that stole your card . 
she's got my life. i want to see who she is . 
go to the post office! i'm sure her picture's up . 
honey, you're kind of losing it here . 
this is really becoming a weird obsession . 
this is madness, i tell you . 
for the love of god, monica, don't do it . 
thank you . 
what do you think . 
lots of things . 
which one do you think she is . 
may i help you . 
oh, no, thanks . 
we're just here to observe . 
you don't observe a dance class. you dance a dance class . 
spare shoes are over there . 
what does she mean . 
i think she means, "you dance a dance class! . 
come on, come on, come on . 
really . 
hey, do you see anybody you think could be me . 
people, last time there were yogurt containers lying around after class . 
let's not have that happen again . 
she could be you . 
let's get started . 
five, six. five, six, seven, eight . 
okay, i'm not getting this . 
i'm totally getting it . 
do you ever just feel like you're so unbelievably uncoordinated . 
what? you just click when they click . 
all right. now everyone grab a partner . 
oh! oh . 
all right. and my dead mother said you are it! i'm with rachel . 
great, it's gym class all over again . 
aww . 
that's all right. you can come up to the front and dance with me . 
why don't i just take off my clothes and have a nightmare . 
it's okay, it's okay! i'm here, i'm here. i'm so sorry i'm late . 
okay, here i am . 
so who's the new tense girl . 
she's your partner . 
hi, i'm monica . 
hi . 
oh, ha . 
monica . 
hi, i'm mo . 
nana . 
monana . 
yeah . 
it's dutch . 
you're kidding. i spent three years in amsterdam . 
um, pennsylvania dutch . 
and we're dancing . 
five, six, seven, eight . 
hi . 
hey . 
hey . 
where have you been . 
i just got back from the vet . 
she's not gonna make you wear a big plastic cone, is she . 
she says marcel's humping thing is not a phase . 
apparently, he's reached sexual maturity . 
hey, he beat you . 
she says, as time goes on, he'll start getting aggressive and violent . 
what does this mean . 
i have to give him up . 
i can't believe it. this sucks . 
you just got him. how could he be an adult already . 
i know, i know. one day he's this little thing and before you know it, he's this little thing i can't get off my leg . 
isn't there any way you can keep him . 
no. no . 
the vet said that unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some monkey loving he's just gonna get vicious . 
i just gotta get him into a zoo . 
how do you get a monkey into a zoo . 
i know that one . 
no, that's popes into a volkswagen . 
we're applying to a lot of them. our first choice would be a state zoo . 
you know, like, uh, san diego . 
right . 
but that may just be a pipe dream because he's out-of-state . 
my vet knows someone at miami, so that's a possibility . 
but that's two blocks from the beach. it's a total party zoo . 
hey.  hey . 
hi . 
we found the girl . 
what . 
did you call the cops . 
nope. we took her to lunch . 
ah. your own brand of vigilante justice . 
are you insane? this woman stole from you . 
she stole! she's a stealer . 
after you're with this woman for 10 minutes, you forget all that . 
i mean, she's this astounding person with this amazing spirit . 
yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader . 
take off their hats . 
popes in a volkswagen . 
mm-hm . 
i love that joke . 
no way! no way did you do this . 
monana was very brave . 
it was so wild . 
we told them we were the gunnersons in room 615 only to find out the boston celtics had the entire sixth floor . 
so when they caught on to the fact that we're short and have breasts they threw us out. i was thrown out of a hotel! me . 
go, monana . 
well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream . 
i get to go pour coffee for people i don't know. don't wait up . 
oh, by the way tomorrow we're auditioning for a broadway show . 
excuse me . 
there's an open call for cats . 
i'm thinking we go down there, sing "memories" and make complete fools of ourselves. what do you say . 
no, no, no . 
remember who you're dealing with here. ha . 
i'm not like you. i can't even stand in front of a tap class . 
that's because of your amish background . 
what . 
well, you're pennsylvania dutch, right . 
right . 
till i bought a blow dryer. then i was shunned . 
i was just like you . 
and then one day, i saw a movie that changed my life . 
did you ever see dead poets society . 
uh-huh . 
i thought that movie was so incredibly boring . 
i mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play . 
what was that . 
it's like, "kid, wait a year. leave home, do some community theater! . 
i walked out of there, and i thought . 
now, that's two hours of my life that i'm never getting back! . 
and that scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do . 
wow . 
then i would definitely not recommend mrs. doubtfire . 
oh, god . 
we didn't get into scranton . 
that was our safety zoo . 
they take, like, dogs and cows . 
see . 
i don't know who this is harder on, me or him . 
i'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it . 
marcel. marcel . 
marcel, no . 
good boy . 
see? how can nobody want him . 
somebody will . 
you know there already is a joseph stalin . 
you're kidding . 
apparently, he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people . 
you'd think you would've known that . 
you'd think i would've . 
phoebe, what do you think a good stage name for me would be . 
flame boy . 
where exactly is your zoo . 
well, it's technically not a zoo per se . 
it's, uh, more of an interactive wildlife experience . 
let me ask you some questions about is it, uh, marcel . 
yes . 
yes. u . 
does he, uh, fight with other animals . 
no, no. he's very docile . 
hmm. even if he were cornered . 
well, i don't know. why . 
um, how is he at handling small objects . 
he can hold a banana, if that's what you mean . 
what about a hammer or a small blade . 
if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns you got to give the little guy something . 
otherwise, it's just cruel . 
what . 
yeah . 
we were coming back from our walk, and the phone was ringin . 
he's in . 
he's in? ah . 
did you hear that, marcel . 
san diego! san diego! yeah . 
you're making a mistake. san diego's well and good but if you give him to me, i'll start him against a blind rabbit and give you 20 percent of the gate . 
yo-ho . 
where have you been . 
monica and i just crashed an embassy party . 
are you drunk . 
no . 
i'm lying . 
i am so drunk . 
oh, god . 
ugh. great. you know what? you could have called . 
i've been up here. i've been worrie . 
monica . 
monica . 
water rules . 
yes. yes, it does . 
the restaurant called. they want to know if you're showing up . 
nope . 
i'm going to the big apple circus today . 
what are you doing? you're gonna lose your job. this is not you . 
no, it is me . 
i'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in . 
you know, when i'm with her, i'm so much more than that . 
i' . 
i'm monana . 
ahem, hello . 
yes, she is. hold on a second, please . 
ahem, monana, it's for you . 
the credit card people . 
hello . 
yes . 
oh, my god . 
thanks . 
what . 
they've arrested monica . 
hi . 
hey . 
how are you . 
i'm not too bad. fortunately, blue's my color . 
how did you know i was here . 
because i'm monica geller . 
it was my credit card you were using . 
that i was not expecting . 
i want you to know, i didn't turn you in . 
oh . 
thanks . 
no, thank you . 
you have given me so much . 
if it wasn't for you, i'd never have gotten to sing "memories" at the winter garden theater . 
actually, you only got to sing "memo . 
i can't believe you're in here. what am i gonna do without you . 
who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me . 
who's gonna take me to the big apple circus . 
monica, i started my day by peeing in front of 25 other women and you're worried about who will take you to the big apple circus . 
well, not worried, you know, just wondering . 
there's nothing to wonder about . 
you'll go back to being who you were because that's who you are . 
not necessarily . 
yes, necessarily . 
i don't know what it is. maybe it's the amish thing . 
um, i'm not actually amish . 
really? then why are you like that . 
you by the door, in or out . 
in . 
you in the back, you're getting it wrong . 
at least i'm doing it . 
this is the final boarding call for flight 67 to san diego boarding at gate 42a . 
okay, goodbye, little monkey guy . 
i wrote you this poem . 
aw . 
okay, but don't eat it till you get on the plane . 
thank you, aunt phoebe . 
aww . 
okay, bye, champ . 
there's gonna be a lot of babes in san diego but remember, there's also a lot to learn . 
i don't know what to say, ross. uh, it's a monkey . 
just say what you feel, joey . 
marcel, i'm hungry . 
that was good . 
marcel, this is for you . 
oh . 
it's, uh, just, you know, something to, um do on the plane . 
if you don't mind, i'd like a moment, just me and him . 
sure . 
of course. absolutely . 
oh . 
marcel, come here. come here . 
come here . 
well, buddy this is it . 
there's just a couple of things i wanted to say . 
i'm really gonna miss you . 
you know? and i'm never gonna forget about you . 
you've been more than just a pet to me . 
you've been more like  . 
okay. marcel, would you . 
marcel, would you leave my leg alone . 
would you just stop humping me for two seconds? marc would you . 
okay, would you just take him away? just take him . 
o! that i were a glove upon that hand that i might touch thy cheek . 
that's fine. thank you . 
next . 
hi. uh, i'll be reading for the role of mercutio . 
name . 
holden mcgroin . 
tell him. please tell him . 
tell him . 
shut up . 
tell me what . 
you won't even look at him . 
oh, come on, tell me . 
i could use another reason why women won't look at me . 
all right, all right, all right . 
last night, i had a dream that, um, you and i were, u . 
doing it on this table . 
wow . 
excellent dream score . 
why? why would you dream that . 
more importantly, was i any good . 
well, you were pretty damned good. ha, ha . 
interesting, because in my dreams, i'm surprisingly inadequate . 
well, last night, you seemed to know your way around the table . 
i love it when we share . 
you okay there . 
i can't believe you two had sex in her dream . 
i'm sorry. it was a one-time thing . 
i was very drunk, and it was someone else's subconscious . 
hello, rachel . 
ugh . 
get off . 
ooh. oh, give me. can you see me operating a drill press . 
i don't know. what are you wearing . 
pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press . 
just for some short-term work . 
you know, till i get back some of my massage clients . 
pirates again . 
no. nothing like that . 
i'm just such a dummy . 
i taught this "massage yourself at home" workshop . 
and they are . 
hey, hey, chan, she could work for you . 
thanks, joey. that's a good idea . 
what? i could. i could do it. what is it . 
well, my secretary's gonna be out . 
she's having one of her boobs reduced . 
it's a whole big boob story . 
i could be a secretary . 
well, i don't know if it's your kind of thing because, uh, it involves a lot of being normal ahem, for a large portion of the day . 
i could do that . 
what are you playing with . 
it's my new beeper . 
why the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for . 
is it, like, for dinosaur emergencies? "help, come quick! they're still extinct! . 
no, it's for when carol goes into labor. she can get me wherever i am . 
all she has to do is dial 55-jimbo . 
a cool phone number and a possible name for the kid . 
i'll see you guys later . 
off to see young ethan . 
thank you . 
how young is young ethan? young . 
he's our age . 
when we were . 
okay, he's a senior in college . 
college . 
ooh . 
whoa . 
and this man-child has no problem with how old you are . 
no, of course not . 
it's not even an issue because i told him i was 22 . 
what . 
what . 
oh, i can't pass for 22 . 
well, maybe 25, 26 . 
i am 26 . 
there you go .

yeah. ha, ha . 
that'll stop when you pick up the phone .

okay . 
all right. bye-bye . 
bye-bye . 
yes . 
what you doing . 
okay, windows are clean, candles are lit . 
ooh, belt's too tight. gotta change the belt . 
did i turn the fish? nope, because i made lasagna .

just a touch . 
mon, i don't understand . 
i mean, you've been dating this guy since, like, his midterms . 
i mean, why all of a sudden are you so . 
oh . 
what . 
could tonight be the night . 
i don't know . 
look, he's a great guy, and i love being with him, but, you know things happen when they happen . 
you don't plan these things . 
oh. so did you shave your legs . 
yeah . 
uh-huh . 
would you let it go, ross? it was just a dream . 
it doesn't mean oh, oh, oh. oh, this is it. oh, my god. it's baby time. baby time . 
all right, relax, relax, just relax, just relax. be cool . 
yeah, hi, i was just beeped .

heh. no, sir, i do not perform those kind of services . 
services? oh, services . 
yeah, you want 55-jumbo . 
yeah . 
that's right . 
that's right. "jumbo" with a u, sir . 
heh. no, you don't want me . 
judging by his number, i'd be a huge disappointment . 
yeah. alrighty, bye-bye . 
hey, hey. how was the first day . 
hey. oh . 
excellent. everyone was so, so nice . 
see? it pays to know the man who wears my shoes . 
me . 
ah . 
i didn't tell anybody that i knew you . 
why not . 
well, because, you know . 
they don't like you . 
what . 
i thought you knew that . 
nah-uh . 
who doesn't like me . 
everyone . 
except for, u . 
no. everyone . 
what are you talking about . 
don't feel bad . 
you know, they used to like you a lot . 
but then you got promoted, and now you're all, like, mr. boss-man . 
you know, mr. bing. mr. bing. boss-man bing . 
i can't believe it . 
yeah, yeah. they even do you . 
they do me . 
yeah . 
you know, like, um, okay . 
could that report be any later? . 
i don't sound like that . 
oh, oh. chandler . 
oh. yeah, you do . 
the hills are alive with the sound of music. . 
my scone! . 
my scone! . 
okay, i don't sound like that. that is so not true . 
that is so not that is so not tha . 
oh, shut up . 
ha, ha. you did not . 
i am telling you, up until i was 9 i thought gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happened . 
ha, ha. how is that possible . 
think about it. it's always on the news . 
a man is being held up at gunpoint. . 
tourists are being terrorized at gunpoint. . 
and i just kept thinking, "why do people continue to go there? . 
oh, ah . 
i should go . 
okay . 
okay . 
unles . 
what . 
uh, unless you wanna stay over . 
i mean, i'm going to. s . 
yeah, i'd really like that . 
uh, before we get into any staying-over stuff there's something you should know . 
okay. is this like "i have an early class tomorrow" or "i'm secretly married to a goat" . 
well, it's somewhere in between . 
you see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, i'm not, uh well, i mean, i haven't ever, u . 
ethan . 
yeah . 
are you a virgin . 
well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then yes, i am . 
i, uh i've kind of been waiting for the right person . 
really . 
yeah . 
you do know i was talking about you, right . 
wow . 
you keep saying that . 
you know, you read about it. you see it in the movies . 
even when you practice it at home, man, oh, man it is nothing like that . 
oh . 
listen, listen . 
um, you told me something that was really difficult for you . 
and, um, well, i figure if you can be honest, then i can too . 
oh, god, don't tell me i did it wrong . 
no . 
no, no, no . 
oh . 
nothing wrong about that . 
oh. ha, ha . 
um, okay. here goes . 
i'm not 22 . 
i'm 25 . 
and 13 months . 
huh . 
but i figure, you know, that shouldn't change anything . 
i mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are . 
listen, um as long as we're telling stuff, uh i have another one for you . 
i'm a little younger than i said . 
you're not a senior . 
oh, i'm a senior . 
in high school . 
okay . 
what we did was wrong . 
oh, god. i just had sex with someone who wasn't alive during the bicentennial . 
i just had sex . 
ethan, focus. how could you not tell me .

mr. "i'm-one-of-you"-boss . 
mr. "i-wanna-be-your-buddy"- boss-man-bing . 
then i don't get it . 
well, you know what, chandler? i think you just gotta face it .

and they found their bodies the very nex . 
la, la, la, la, la, l . 
help . 
no, mom, everything's going fine, really. yeah, ross is great. he's, uh he's in a whole other place. yeah. no, he's gone . 
no, no, you don't have to fly back. really . 
what do you mean, this might be your only chance . 
oh. would you stop? i'm only 26 . 
i'm not even thinking about babies yet . 
where have you been?  oh, i just had a baby . 
mazel tov . 
i don't know. it could be an hour, it could be three . 
but relax, she's doing great . 
so, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone . 
no. no, not at at the moment, no, i'm not, no . 
are you . 
no, no . 
it's hard enough to get women to go out with me . 
heh. right, yeah, i've heard that about cute doctors . 
no, no, really . 
i suppose it's because i spend so much time, you know where i do . 
oh . 
mm . 
i try not to let work affect my personal life, but it's hard when you do what i do. it's like, u . 
well, for instance, what do you do . 
i'm a waitress . 
okay, all right . 
well, aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day and you're just like, "if i see one more cup of coffee . 
ahem. yeah. gotcha . 
i'm gonna check up on your friend . 
okay, that's fine . 
so how did you know i was even here?  your mom called me . 
so is this her . 
no, this is a loaner . 
listen, i'm sorry you had to do this by yourself . 
oh. i wasn't by myself. i had a doctor, a nurse and a helper guy . 
so did you see who won the game . 
yeah, knicks by 10. they suck . 
eh, they're not so bad . 
come on. come on . 
damn it, damn it, damn it. this is all your fault . 
this is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life . 
my son is being born, and i should be in there, you know . 
instead i'm stuck in a closet with you . 
i've been waiting for this just as much as you have . 
believe me, no one has been waiting for this as much as i have, okay . 
and you know what the funny thing is . 
when this day is over, you get to go home with the baby . 
where does that leave me . 
you get to be the father . 
everyone knows who you are. who am i? there's father's day. there's mother's day . 
there's no lesbian lover day . 
every day is lesbian lover day . 
this is so great . 
you wanna explain that . 
i mean, well, because when i was growing up, you know, my dad left and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail . 
so i barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one . 
and here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they fight over who gets to love it the most and it's not even born yet . 
it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world . 
i'm sorry. you were fighting . 
where are they . 
i'm sure they'll be here soon . 
they wouldn't miss this . 
relax. you're only at nine centimeters, and the baby's at zero station . 
okay, you are really frightening me . 
somebody wanna help me? trying to rip out my heart . 
uh oh, that's great. anybody seen a nipple . 
all right. ten centimeters. here we go . 
all right, honey, time to start pushing . 
but they're not here yet . 
sorry, i can't tell the baby to wait for them . 
oh, god .

i'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys . 
hey, you know what? tell them that bone story . 
hi . 
hey . 
hey . 
i have to go to china . 
the country . 
no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront . 
do you guys know who carl is . 
let's see. alvin, simon, theodor . 
no . 
well, rachel's having drinks with him . 
oh, no . 
how can she, when she's never shown interest in you . 
forget about her . 
he's right, man. please move on. go to china. eat chinese food . 
of course, there they just call it food . 
yeah? i guess. i don't know . 
all right, just give her this for me, okay . 
listen, we're just looking out for you . 
i know . 
we want you to be happy . 
and i may only have a couple beers in me, but i love you, man . 
i'm still on my first . 
i just think you're nice . 
anyway, that's when me and my friends started this fruit-basket business . 
we call ourselves "the three basketeers." ha, ha . 
like "the three musketeers," only with fruit . 
oh . 
okay . 
how do you like your burgers . 
no. presents first, food later . 
hold on there, tiger . 
how's it going? how you holding up . 
well, not so good . 
she thinks tonight's the night we're gonna complete the transaction if you know what  . 
and you do. heh . 
so, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her . 
what do you mean . 
you know, just be there for her . 
not following you . 
think about it . 
okay, i'm guessing this is fro . 
well, thank you, melanie . 
okay, this one right here is from me . 
okay . 
hmm. ah, it's light . 
it rattles. it's travel scrabble . 
ha, ha, hey . 
wow. thank you . 
this one's from joey . 
it feels like a book. i think it's a book. feels like a book. and it's a book . 
it's dr. seuss . 
that book got me through some tough times . 
there is a little child inside this man . 
the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die . 
who's this from . 
that's, uh, ross' . 
ah . 
oh, my god . 
he remembered . 
remembered what . 
it was, like, months ago . 
we were walking by this antique store, and i saw this pin in the window . 
i told him it was just like one my grandmother had when i was little . 
aw! i can't believe he remembered . 
well, sure, but can you play it on a plane . 
oh, it's so pretty . 
this must've cost him a fortune . 
i can't believe he did this . 
ross? remember when he fell in love with carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck . 
what did you just say . 
crystal duck . 
no, no, no . 
the, um the "love" part . 
oh, my god . 
oh, no, no, no, no . 
that's good. just keep rubbing your head . 
that'll turn back time . 
this is unbelievable. i mean, this is unbelievable . 
i know. this is really, really huge . 
no, it's not. it's small, it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee . 
uh-uh. i don't think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again . 
is there a mute button on this woman . 
i think this is so great! i mean, you and ross . 
did you have any idea . 
no, none . 
my first night in the city, he mentioned asking me out but nothing ever happened, so i just what else did he say? does he want to go out with me . 
given that he's desperately in love with you he wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something . 
ross . 
all this time . 
i've gotta talk to him . 
he's in china . 
the country . 
wait, his flight doesn't leave for 45 minutes . 
what about the time difference? from here to the airport . 
yes . 
you're never gonna make it . 
i've got to try . 
what are you gonna say to him . 
i don't know . 
maybe you shouldn't go . 
right, because if you're gonna break his heart, that can wait . 
yeah, but if it's good news, tell him now . 
maybe i'll know when i see him . 
here, look. all right, does this help . 
no . 
all i know is, i cannot wait a week. this is just too big . 
i've just got to talk to him. i've go . 
i'll see you later . 
i love you . 
deal with me first . 
all right . 
ross! ross . 
excuse me, pardon me . 
hi. your boarding pass . 
hi . 
no, i need to talk to my friend . 
sorry, you're not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass . 
he just went on. he's right there, in the blue jacket! can i just . 
i'm sorry. federal regulations . 
all right, um, then could you please just give him a message for me . 
please? this is very important . 
all right. what's the message . 
uh i don't know . 
excuse me! sir! excuse me! sir . 
i have a message for you . 
what . 
it's from rachel. she loved the present. she'll see you when you get back . 
what . 
toby, i don't know what she's talking about . 
there's no rachel . 
don't give me that deep freeze . 
oh, joey, joey, joey . 
i think i blacked out there for a minute . 
it was nothing . 
well, now we gotta find something fun for you . 
ahh, you know what . 
forget about me. let's, uh let's give you another turn . 
me, again . 
sure. why not . 
boy! somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow . 
i gotta tell you, you are nothing like i thought you would be . 
how do you mean . 
i just had you pegged as one of those guys who are always, "me, me, me! . 
ha, ha . 
but you you're a giver . 
you're, like, the most generous man i ever met . 
i mean, you're practically a woman . 
so, uh, rach, do you want to save this wrapping paper . 
it's only a little torn . 
are you gonna go for it with ross, or should i throw it out . 
i don't know . 
thought about it all of the way there and i thought about it all the way back and, u . 
you know, it's ross . 
you know what i mean? it's ross . 
sure . 
sure . 
i don't know. this is just my initial gut feeling but i'm thinking it'd be really great . 
oh, my god, me too! oh, we'd be like friends-in-law . 
the best part is you already know everything about him . 
it's like starting on the 15th date . 
but it would be like starting on the 15th date . 
another good point . 
no, i mean at the 15th date, you're already in a "relationship-y" place . 
you're committed . 
huh . 
what happens if it doesn't work out . 
why isn't it working out . 
i don't know, sometimes it doesn't . 
is he not cute enough for you? does he not make enough money . 
no, i'm jus . 
maybe there's someone else . 
is there? is there someone else . 
no, there is no one else . 
then why the hell are you dumping my brother . 
wha . 
hey, bi . 
shh . 
she's still asleep . 
so how'd it go . 
it was amazing . 
you know how you think you're great in bed . 
the fact you'd even ask shows how little you know me . 
well, it's like, last night i couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great . 
so i had to do all this other stuff . 
and the response i got! man, oh, man . 
it was like a ticker-tape parade . 
yes i know. as it happens, my room is very close to the parade route . 
it was amazing, and not just for her. uh-uh. for me too . 
it's like, all of a sudden, i'm blind but all my other senses are heightened . 
you know? it's like, i was able to appreciate it on another level . 
i didn't know you had another level . 
i know. neither did i . 
hey, great skirts! birthday present . 
yeah . 
from who . 
from you . 
i exchanged the blouse you got me . 
well, it's the thought . 
doesn't ross' flight get in in a couple hours . 
at gate 27b . 
uh, yeah . 
monica, you know, i've been thinking about it . 
i've decided this ross thing is not a good idea . 
why . 
because i feel like i wouldn't just be going out with him . 
i would be going out with all of you . 
ugh, there'd be all this pressure an . 
no pressure, no pressure . 
nothing has even happened yet and you're already s . 
i'm not "so. . 
i was a teensy bit weird at first but i'll be good. i promise . 
who is it . 
it's me, carl . 
come on up . 
behind my brother's back . 
is the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me . 
seven hundred bucks . 
all right, you did it . 
do we have any fruit . 
man, hell of a two weeks, huh . 
you know what, though? i really feel i learned something . 
so you'll stick with this "it's all for her" thing . 
what, are you crazy . 
when a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this . 
i'm just saying, if i see one more picture of ed begley jr in that stupid electric car i'm gonna shoot myself . 
don't get me wrong. i'm not against environmental issues, per se it's just that guy . 
i can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me . 
excuse me, please. i'm trying to have a date here . 
fine, just stop thinking about me . 
can't do it, can you . 
so i'm thinking about you. so what . 
i don't get it. what do you see in this guy anyway . 
well, he seems to be a very nice guy . 
i mean, come on, buddy! get a real car . 
rachel, come on. give us a chance . 
ross, it's too hard . 
no, no . 
because it'll get weird for everyone else . 
who cares about them? this is about us . 
i've been in love with you since the ninth grade . 
you're, like, my best friend . 
i know . 
if we broke up, and i lost yo . 
whoa . 
why do you think we'll break up . 
have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up . 
no . 
but it only has to happen once . 
you and i know we are perfect for each other . 
right . 
are you attracted to me . 
i don't know . 
i mean, i've never looked at you that way before . 
well start looking . 
wow . 
exactly . 
and you just know i'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic . 
right . 
heh . 
you're right . 
you know what . 
what . 
i forgot, i'm supposed to pick up a friend at the airport . 
i am so sorry. i'm so if you want to stay and finish your drinks, please do . 
i'm sorry, i gotta go. i'm sorry .

but there was always this voice . 
it's never gonna happen. move on." you know whose voice that was .

well, maybe it was god doing me . 
you were right. she looks at me and sees a friend. that's all . 
and then i met julie, an . 
i don't know. we're having a great time . 
i never would have gone for it with her, if it hadn't been for you .

okay, so, uh, what did you find out . 
he sai . 
he said they're having a great time . 
i'm sorry . 
what . 
but the silver lining, if you wanna see it is that he made this decision all by himself without any outside help whatsoever . 
how is that a silver lining . 
you have to really wanna see it . 
ironically, these guys were picked last in gym . 
hey, pheebs . 
you know what i'm thinking . 
oh, okay . 
how it's been so long since you've had sex you're wondering if they've changed it .

so, what were you thinking . 
i was thinking you gave the guys great haircuts . 
i thought you'd like to do mine . 
oh! no .

rachel, how did this happen . 
i don't know, i kind of ran into him last night . 
where . 
at his apartment . 
is this juice . 
whoa. and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe . 
oh, god, i know. i'm pathetic, i'm a loser . 
honey, you're not pathetic. you're just sad . 
yeah. people do stupid things when they're upset . 
my god, if i had a nickel for every guy i wish i hadn' . 
but this is about your horrible mistake . 
hi . 
hey . 
h . 
sorry we're late .

well, there was touching . 
hey .

ah . 
so, uh, he's back . 
yeah, he's back. is that a problem . 
no, not a problem . 
good. glad it's not a problem . 
okay, you're gonna have to not touch my ass . 
well, despite the yummy bagels and palpable tension i've got pants that need to be altered . 
oh, when you see frankie, tell him joey tribbiani says hello . 
he'll know what it means . 
you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code . 
it's funny. the last time paolo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter . 
all right. okay . 
but but! you have to promise that you will not be all controlly and bossy and all, you know, monica about it . 
i promise . 
all right, let's see . 
now, some of you are gonna get cut and some of you aren't . 
but i promise, none of you will feel a thing . 
okay . 
all right, that's it. i quit . 
what? i didn't say anything . 
yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person . 
this is the face of a person who, you know doesn't trust a person . 
i'm sorry. i'm sorry, phoebe . 
it's just a little shorter than what we had discussed . 
would you relax? i know what i am doing . 
this is how he wears it . 
how who wears it . 
demi moore . 
heh. demi moore is not a he . 
well, he was a he in arthur and in 10 . 
that's dudley moore . 
i said i wanted it like demi moore . 
oh. oh . 
oh, my god . 
oh, god . 
oh, my god . 
oh, my god! i'm sorry! i'm sorry! i'm sorry . 
which one is demi moore . 
she's the actress that was in disclosure, indecent proposal, ghost . 
oh, she's got gorgeous hair . 
i know . 
oh, my god . 
how long do you want the cuffs . 
at least as long as i have the pants . 
i just got that . 
okay. now we'll do your inseam . 
how is she . 
it's too soon to tell . 
she's resting, which is a good sign . 
how's the hair . 
i'm not gonna lie to you, ross . 
it doesn't look good . 
i put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling . 
can we see her . 
your hair looks too good. it would upset her . 
ross, why don't you come on in . 
well, how you doing . 
i'm okay . 
ooh, that bad, huh . 
what . 
look, i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable . 
it's one of my gifts. sit . 
ugh . 
ugh, joey, when i saw him get off that plane with her i really thought i just hit rock bottom . 
but today, it's like there's rock bottom 50 feet of crap then me . 
you gotta tell ross how you feel . 
oh, come on, how can i just tell him? what about julie . 
what about her? they've only been going out for two weeks . 
ross has been in love with you for 10 years . 
i don't know. i don't know . 
look, rach, rach . 
i've been with my share of women . 
i've been with a lot of people's share of women . 
but the point is i've never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you . 
really . 
yo, paisan . 
can i talk to you for a sec . 
your tailor is a very bad man . 
frankie? what are you talking about . 
hey, what's going on . 
joey's tailor took advantage of me . 
what . 
no way . 
i've been going to the guy for 12 years . 
oh, come on. he said he was gonna do my inseam . 
then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definit . 
what . 
cupping . 
that's how they do pants . 
first they go up one side, they move it over . 
then they go up the other side, move it back, then they do the rear . 
what? ross, tell him. isn't that how a tailor measures pants . 
yes, yes, it is. in prison . 
what's the matter with you . 
what . 
that's not . 
oh, my god . 
even mary tyler moore would've been better . 
i like it . 
yeah, i do. i think it's a 10 . 
thank you. my hair is very amused . 
oh, come on, things could be worse. i mean, uh you could "get caught between the moon and new york city . 
i know it's crazy, but it's true. . 
thank you . 
well, i gotta go. bye . 
see you . 
bye, rach . 
wait, are you leaving . 
that's what i meant by "bye. . 
well, uh, can i talk to you for a sec . 
okay . 
when the doctor does that hernia tes . 
that's okay . 
what's going on . 
u . 
well, um, okay, first of al . 
mm-hm . 
paolo and i are not back together . 
that was a stupid thing i did . 
if i could go back in time and do it again well, i wouldn't . 
ahem . 
u . 
heh . 
second of al . 
what . 
before i say anything is this one of those things where you break up with a guy . 
then i tell you what i think and the next day you get back together with him and i look like a complete idiot . 
no, no, no . 
okay. um, well, then, i think the guy's scum . 
i hate him. i mean, i actually i physically hate him . 
you know? i always have . 
and you are way too good to be with a guy like that . 
really . 
rach . 
you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing and adorable and sexy you are . 
you know? someone who wakes up . 
oh, my god. i'm with rachel!" heh . 
you know? someone who makes you feel good . 
like the way i do with julie . 
was there a "second of all" . 
u . 
no, um, i think that was the whole "all. . 
i gotta go. okay . 
okay . 
thanks . 
okay . 
no, i swear to god, dad . 
that's not how they measure pants . 
i was thinking of doing it shorter, like andie macdowell's haircut . 
oh, yeah. oh, i could do that . 
really . 
yeah. you wanna do it now . 
great . 
okay . 
okay . 
see you . 
okay, i just wanna make really sure this time . 
uh-huh. ahem . 
andie macdowell is the girl from four weddings and a funeral, right . 
no . 
no, no, no, no, no, no. that's roddy mcdowall . 
andie macdowell is the guy from planet of the apes . 
oh! yeah, okay . 
yeah. okay . 
thank you . 
you're welcome . 
okay, these were expensive, and he's gonna grow out of them in 20 minutes, but i couldn't resist . 
aww .

monica, she will kill you . 
she will kill you like a dog in the street . 
so, uh, jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow .

it's not the first time i lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne . 
bijan for men . 
bijan for men . 
okay, and this is funny clown . 
funny clown is only for after his naps, not before or he won't sleep . 
we've been through this before. we have a good time .

uh-huh. okay, um, sure . 
that'd be great. see you then. bye . 
did you just say, "hi, jew" .

that was my friend eddie moskowitz . 
yeah, he likes it. reaffirms his faith . 
ben, dinner . 
thanks, aunt pheebs . 
you didn't microwave that, did you? it's breast milk, you're not supposed to . 
duh, i think i know how to heat breast milk. heh . 
okay . 
what did you just do . 
i licked my arm, what . 
it's breast milk . 
so . 
phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person . 
what is the big deal . 
no, n . 
what did you just do . 
can people stop drinking the breast milk . 
you won't even taste it . 
no . 
not even if you just pretend it's milk . 
not even if carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it . 
hey . 
hi . 
where is everybody . 
took ben to the park . 
where have you been . 
just out . 
had some lunch. just me. a little quality time with me . 
hey, thanks for your jacket . 
oh, no problem . 
you can borrow it, by the way . 
heh . 
oh, here are your keys, honey . 
thank you . 
mon . 
mm-hmm . 
if, uh, you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53 . 
you know what probably happened . 
someone must have stolen my credit card . 
ah . 
and put the receipt back in your pocket . 
huh. that is an excellent, excellent question . 
that is excellent . 
what's with you? who did you have lunch with . 
judy . 
who . 
julie. jody . 
what . 
you were with julie . 
mm. look . 
when it started, i was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend . 
and then one thing led to another and before i knew it, we were shopping . 
aah . 
oh, my god . 
wait, we only did it once . 
it didn't mean anything to me . 
yeah, right. sure . 
really . 
rachel, i was thinking of you the whole time . 
look, i'm sorry, all right? i never meant for you to find out . 
oh, please! please! you wanted to get caught . 
that is not true . 
so you just happened to leave it in here . 
did it ever occur to you that i might just be that stupid . 
okay, monica, i just have to know one thing . 
did you go with her to bloomingdale's . 
okay. okay . 
okay, i just really, um i just need to not be with you right now . 
hi, who's this . 
hi, joanne. is rachel working? it's monica . 
yes, i know i did a horrible thing . 
joanne, it's not as simple as all that, okay . 
no, i don't care what steve thinks. hi, steve . 
hey . 
hi . 
how did we do . 
oh, i tasted ben's milk and ross freaked out . 
i i did not freak out . 
why'd you freak out . 
because it's breast milk . 
it's gross . 
my breast milk is gross . 
this should be fun . 
no, carol. there's nothing wrong with it . 
i just don't think breast milk is for adults . 
of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids . 
ross, you're being silly. i've tried it. it's no big deal . 
come on, just taste it . 
ha-ha-ha . 
that would be no . 
come on . 
try it . 
it's natural . 
it doesn't taste bad . 
yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. sort of like, u . 
like what . 
cantaloupe juice . 
exactly . 
you've tasted it . 
you've tasted it . 
uh-huh . 
oh, you've tasted it . 
you can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true . 
give me the bottle . 
get me the towel . 
howdy . 
give me a box ofjuice . 
well, they switched me over to hombre . 
maybe it's because of the way you're dressed . 
or maybe this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it . 
this guy goes through two bottles a day now . 
what do you care . 
you're an actor. this is your day job. isn't supposed to mean anything . 
i know, but i was the best . 
you know? i liked being the best . 
maybe i should get out of the game . 
they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese . 
say you do that . 
sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar . 
and then where you gonna run . 
i guess you're right . 
damn right i'm right . 
show this guy what you're made of. stand your ground . 
show him that you're the baddest hombre west of the lingerie . 
i'm gonna do it . 
all right . 
now, go see miss kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker . 
i don't know what to say . 
that works good because i'm not listening . 
i feel terrible. i really do . 
oh, i'm sorry. did my back hurt your knife . 
rachel . 
say that i'm friends with her. we spend time together . 
is that so terrible . 
yes . 
it's that terrible . 
yes, monica! you don't get it . 
it's bad enough she stole the guy who may be the person i'm supposed to be with . 
but now she's actuall . 
but now she's actually stealing you . 
me . 
what are you talking about . 
nobody could steal me from you . 
because i'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you . 
honey . 
i mean, you're my and we'r . 
oh, i love you . 
i love you too . 
you guys, um, i know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me . 
but, um, i love you guys too . 
ugh, i really needed that . 
look, i know you're in a place right now where you really need to hate julie's guts . 
but she didn't do anything wrong . 
she's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out . 
i think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her . 
will you give that a chance . 
for me . 
i'd do anything for you, you know that . 
i'd do anything for you . 
wait, wait, wait, wait . 
morning . 
heh. i said, morning . 
i heard you . 
all right, everybody. i'm opening the doors . 
you boys ready . 
ready . 
yeah, i'm ready . 
you idiot! you stupid cowboy . 
you've blinded me! i'm suing . 
oh, my god! todd! what the hell did you do . 
i'm sorry. i'm such a doofus . 
i'm so sorry. i'm so sorry . 
my god, what happened . 
eh, these new kids, they never last . 
sooner or later they all stop lasting . 
listen, uh, what do you say i buy you that cup of coffee now . 
sure . 
so . 
so . 
i just thought the two of us should hang out a bit . 
i mean, you know, we've never really talked . 
i guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us. ha, ha, right . 
i know . 
mm . 
i probably shouldn't even tell you this but i'm pretty much totally intimidated by you . 
really? me . 
oh, my god, are you kidding . 
ross is so crazy about you and i really wanted you to like me, and i it's probably me just being totally paranoid but i kind of got the feeling that maybe you don't . 
well you're not totally paranoid . 
oy . 
um . 
okay. u . 
god. u . 
heh . 
when you and, uh, ross first started going out it was really hard for me, um for many reasons of which i'm not gonna bore you with now, but, um i see how happy he is and how good you guys are together . 
and, um, monica's always saying how nice you are and god, i hate it when she's right . 
thanks . 
yeah . 
listen. would you like to go to a movie sometime or something . 
yeah, that'd be great. i'd love it . 
yeah . 
i'd love it too. okay . 
okay . 
oh, shoot, i gotta go . 
okay . 
so i'll talk to you later . 
all right, julie . 
bye . 
bye . 
what a manipulative bitch . 
it's not bad . 
hey . 
hey . 
so how was joan . 
broke up with her . 
oh, why . 
don't tell me. because of the big nostril thing . 
they were huge . 
when she sneezed, bats flew out of them . 
come on, they were not that huge . 
i'm telling you, she leaned back, i could see her brain . 
how many women will you reject over the most superficial, insignificant things . 
hold it. hold it. i gotta side with chandler on this one . 
when i first moved to the city, i went out with this girl . 
really hot. great kisser but she had the biggest adam's apple . 
drove me nuts . 
you or me . 
i got it . 
joey, women don't have adam's apples . 
heh, heh. you guys are messing with me, right . 
yeah. we are . 
that's a good one. for a second there, i was like, whoa . 
so you name one woman that you broke up with for an actual real reason . 
maureen rasillo . 
because she doesn't hate yanni is not a real reason . 
hello, mr. heckles . 
you're doing it again . 
we're not doing anything . 
you're stomping. it's disturbing my birds . 
you don't have birds . 
i could have birds . 
okay, we'll try to keep it down . 
thank you . 
i'm going to rejoin my dinner party . 
all right, bye-bye . 
okay, janice . 
you gotta give me janice. that wasn't about being picky . 
we'll give you janice . 
i miss janice, though . 
hello, chandler bing . 
oh, my god . 
oh, chandler . 
now! now . 
that's it . 
there! faster . 
ugh. stop with the broom! we're not making noise . 
we won . 
we won! whoo . 
whoo . 
mr. heckles . 
how did this happen . 
he was sweeping . 
they found a broom in his hand . 
oh . 
oh, dear god . 
that's terrible . 
i know . 
i was sweeping yesterday . 
it could've been me . 
yeah . 
sure . 
sweeping. you never know . 
never know . 
okay, it's very faint, but i can still sense him in the building . 
go into the light, mr. heckles . 
okay, phoebe . 
i'm sorry, but sometimes they need help . 
yeah . 
here we go . 
that's fine, go ahead and scoff . 
there are a lot of things i don't believe in but that doesn't mean they're not true . 
such as . 
like crop circles or the bermuda triangle or evolution . 
whoa, whoa, whoa . 
what, you don't believe in evolution . 
no. not really . 
you don't believe in evolution . 
i don't know. it's just, you know monkeys, darwin, it's a nice story. i just think it's a little too easy . 
too easy"? too the process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms is "too easy" . 
yeah, i just don't buy it . 
excuse me. evolution is not for you to buy, phoebe . 
evolution is scientific fact, like the air we breathe like gravity . 
okay, don't get me started on gravity . 
you, uh you don't believe in gravity . 
well, it's not so much that, you know, i don't believe in it . 
lately i get the feeling that i'm not so much being pulled down as i am being pushed . 
pushed . 
uh-oh. it's isaac newton and he's pissed . 
there she is. and over there, that's the other one . 
this is mr. buddy boyle, heckles' attorney . 
he'd like to talk to you . 
what can we do for you . 
all right, kids, here's the deal . 
according my client's will he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine. . 
what about his family . 
he didn't have any . 
whoa . 
okay, so let's talk money . 
all right, there was none . 
now, let's talk signing . 
you be noisy girl number one. you be noisy girl number two . 
i can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us . 
isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life without even knowing it . 
would you look at this dump . 
he hated us! this was his final revenge . 
ever seen so much crap . 
actually, i think this apartment sullies the good name of crap . 
check this out . 
can i have this . 
how can you not believe in evolution . 
i don't know, just don't. look at this funky shirt . 
pheebs, i've studied evolution my entire adult life . 
and i can tell you, we've collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species . 
i mean, you can literally see them evolving through time . 
really? you can actually see it . 
you bet! in the u.s., china, africa, all over . 
see, i didn't know that . 
well, there you go . 
huh . 
so now the real question is, who put those fossils there and why . 
hey. look at this. my big book of grievances . 
hey, there's me . 
april 17th, excessive noise ltalian guy comes home with a date." yeah . 
chandler, you're in here too . 
april 18th, excessive noise ltalian guy's gay roommate brings home dry cleaning. . 
well, that's excellent . 
monica, look at this lamp . 
is this tacky or what? we have to have this . 
i think we have enough regular lamps . 
what? come on, it's not like i'm asking for this girlie clock or anything . 
which, by the way, i also think is really cool . 
look, it doesn't go with any of my stuff . 
well, what about my stuff . 
you don't have any stuff . 
you still think of it as your apartment, don't you . 
mmm no . 
yes, you do . 
you think of it as your apartment and i just rent a room . 
mmm okay, while you "mmm" on that, i'll go find a place for my new lamp . 
okay, pheebs. see how i'm making these little toys move . 
opposable thumbs . 
without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs . 
maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts . 
tell me you're joking . 
look, can't we just say that you believe in something and i don't . 
no. no, pheebs, we can't . 
why not . 
what is this obsessive need you have to make everybody agree with you . 
no, what's that all about? you know what i think . 
i think maybe it's time you put ross under the microscope . 
is there blood coming out of my ears . 
check it out. heckles' high-school yearbook . 
wow. he looks so normal . 
he's even kind of cute . 
heckles, you crack me up in science class . 
you're the funniest kid in school. . 
funniest? heckles . 
that's what it says . 
wow. heckles was voted class clown, and so was i . 
he was right. would you listen to that . 
i'd call that excessive . 
whoa . 
what . 
heckles played clarinet in band, and i played clarinet . 
and he was in the scale modeler's club and i was well, there was no club, but i sure thought they were cool . 
so? you were both dorks . 
big deal . 
i just think it's weird, you know? heckles and me heckles and me. m . 
me and heckles . 
hey, would you knock it off . 
ah . 
have you been here all night . 
look at this . 
pictures of all the women heckles went out with . 
look what he wrote on them. "vivian, too tall. . 
madge, big gums. . 
too loud. . 
too smart." "makes noise when she eats. . 
this is me . 
this is what i do . 
i'm gonna end up alone, just like he did . 
chandler, heckles was a nut case . 
our trains are on the same track . 
i'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same . 
bitter town alone-ville, hermit junction . 
you know what we gotta do? get you out of here . 
come on, i'll buy you breakfast . 
what if i never find somebody? or worse, what if i found her but i dumped her because she pronounces it "supposably" . 
chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody . 
how do you know that? how . 
i don't know. i'm just trying to help you out . 
you guys will all get married and i'll end up alone . 
will you promise me something . 
when you're married, will you invite me over for holidays . 
i don't know what we'll be doing . 
i mean, what if we're over at her folks' place . 
yeah, i understand . 
you can come over and watch the super bowl . 
every year, all right . 
you know what? i'm not gonna end up like this . 
i'll see you, man . 
jeez . 
supposably. . 
supposably . 
did they go to the zoo . 
supposably . 
hi. it's me . 
oh, my god . 
janice? you called janice . 
yes. janice . 
why is that difficult to comprehend . 
you remember janice, right . 
yes. she was smart, she was pretty and she honestly cared about me . 
janice is my last chance to have somebody . 
hello . 
oh, my god . 
jeez, look how fat she got . 
hey, it's everybody . 
hi, janice . 
janice, you'r . 
yes, i am . 
is it . 
is it yours? ha . 
you wish, chandler bing . 
you are looking at a married lady now . 
oh . 
yeah . 
congratulations . 
aw, sweetie, i'm sorry . 
you couldn't tell me on the phone . 
and what? miss the expression on your face? oh, no . 
janice likes to have her fun . 
you know what we haven't played in a while . 
what . 
hide the lamp . 
monica, let it go . 
did you know i'm allergic to shellfish . 
then you'll just have to eat the other lamps . 
uh-oh. it's scary scientist man . 
okay, phoebe, this is it . 
in this briefcase i carry actual scientific facts . 
a briefcase of facts, if you will . 
some of these fossils are over 200 million years old . 
okay, look, before you even start, i'm not denying evolution . 
it's just one of the possibilities . 
it's the only possibility . 
ross, could you just open your mind, like, this much? okay . 
wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believe the earth was flat . 
and up till 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing until you split it open and this whole mess of crap came out . 
now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny, tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this . 
there might be a teeny tiny possibility . 
i can't believe you caved . 
what . 
you just abandoned your whole belief system . 
before, i didn't agree with you, but at least i respected you . 
but how are you gonna go into work tomorrow . 
how are you going to face the other science guys . 
how are you going to face yourself? oh that was fun. so who's hungry . 
i am . 
me too. let me just get my coat . 
what happened . 
okay. all right, it was an accident, i swear . 
i was putting on my jacket and the thing and the lamp and it broke . 
oh, please, monica! you've always hated my lamp . 
and now all of a sudden, it's just magically, it's just broken . 
phoebe, tell her . 
i didn't see it, because i was putting on my jacket . 
but i want to believe you . 
hey, chandler. monica just broke my seashell lamp . 
neat . 
i'm gonna die alone . 
okay, you win . 
chandler, you are not gonna die alone . 
janice was my safety net, okay . 
and now i have to get a snake . 
uh-huh. why is that . 
if i'm gonna be an old, lonely man, i'm gonna need a thing . 
you know, a hook . 
like that guy on the subway who eats his own face . 
so i figure i'll be "crazy man with a snake. . 
crazy snake man . 
then i'll get more snakes, call them my babies . 
kids won't walk past my place, they will run . 
run away from crazy snake man," they'll shout . 
you've got to get over this. okay . 
you won't end up alone . 
of course i am . 
i reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me and then i bitch that there aren't any great women out there . 
chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we've ever gone out with . 
yeah . 
you are not a freak. you're a guy . 
she's right . 
you're no different than the rest . 
wait a minute. wait a minute. yes, he is . 
you are totally different . 
in a bad way . 
no, honey, in a wonderful way . 
you know what you want now . 
most guys don't even have a clue . 
you're ready to take risks, be vulnerable and intimate with someone . 
you're not gonna end up alone . 
you called janice. that's how much you wanted to be with someone . 
you've made it . 
you're there . 
you are ready to make a commitment . 
whoa! don't know about that . 
wow. what you got there . 
something else that's not yours that you can break . 
no . 
i know you like this and i want you to have it . 
it'll look good in our apartment . 
thank you . 
that's fine . 
hey . 
hey . 
you'll all be pleased to know that i have a date tomorrow night . 
this woman allison from work. she is great . 
she's pretty, she's smart. and i've been holding off asking her out in the past, because she has a unusually large head . 
but i'm not going to let that stuff hang me up anymore . 
all right . 
look at me. i'm growing . 
hey, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you . 
i'll take that . 
you want his yearbook . 
yeah. yeah. some people said nice things about him. somebody should have it . 
gosh, this is so weird . 
his whole life was in this apartment and now it's gone . 
i think it would be nice if we just took a few moments for mr. heckles . 
i mean, he was kind of a pain. he was, but he was a person . 
what . 
you're all going to hell . 
it's really not that big . 
taking that with you, huh . 
oh, yeah . 
hey, you coming . 
yeah, in a second . 
goodbye, mr. heckles . 
we'll try to keep it down . 
my major was useless . 
how often do you look in the classifieds and see "philosopher wanted" . 
heh, heh. sure . 
my god, that's a big head . 
it didn't look this big in the office. maybe it's the lighting . 
my head must look like a golf ball at work . 
don't get hung up on it. quick, quick. list five things you like about her . 
nice smile, good dresser . 
big head, big head, big head . 
mom, would you relax . 
that was 10 blocks from here, and the woman was walking alone at night . 
i would never do that . 
mom, come on, stop worrying . 
this is a safe street. this is a safe building. there's nothing aah! oh, my god! what are you doing in here . 
mom, i gotta go. i gotta go . 
oh, my god . 
okay . 
that's fine, you just read the paper . 
i'm gonna get a pot . 
it's not for you . 
okay, that's fine . 
read the family circus enjoy the gentle comed . 
oh, my god. oh, my god. oh, my god . 
ugh. oh, god. oh, god . 
it's open, you guys . 
hi . 
hi. can i help you . 
i'm looking for phoebe, does she still live here . 
uh, no, she doesn't. but i can get a message to her . 
great. uh, just tell her her husband stopped by . 
her what? aah . 
hey, how did you do that . 
this is unbelievable, pheebs. how can you be married . 
i'm not "married" married, you know . 
he was just a friend, and he's gay and he was from canada, and he needed a green card . 
i can't believe you married duncan . 
i mean, how could you not tell me . 
we lived together, we told each other everything . 
i'm sorry, monica, but i knew if i told you, you'd get really, like, judgmental and would not approve . 
of course i wouldn't approve . 
you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay . 
i mean, what the hell were you thinking . 
see? and you thought she'd be judgmental . 
okay, i wasn't in love with him. i was just helping out a friend . 
please. when he left town, you stayed in your pajamas for a month . 
and i saw you eat a cheeseburger . 
well, didn't you . 
i might have . 
i can't believe you didn't tell me . 
come on. like you tell me everything . 
what have i not told you . 
ooh, i don't know. um how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with fun bobby on the terrace . 
what . 
wait a minute. who told you . 
you are dead meat . 
i didn't know it was a big secret . 
oh, it's not big. not at all . 
you know, kind of on the same lines as, say, i don't know, having a third nipple . 
you have a third nipple . 
you bitch . 
whip it out. whip it out . 
yeah, yeah . 
no, come on. there's nothing to see. it's just a tiny bump. it's totally useless . 
oh, as opposed to your other multifunctional nipples . 
i can't believe you. you told me it was a nubbin . 
joey, what did you think a nubbin was . 
i don't know. you see something, you hear a word, i thought that's what it was . 
let me see it again . 
yeah, show us your nubbin . 
joey was in a porno movie . 
if i'm going down, i'm taking everybody with me . 
oh, my god . 
you were in a porno . 
all right, all right. i was young and i just wanted a job, okay . 
but at the last minute i couldn't go through with it . 
so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't because there's people having sex on it . 
wow . 
that is wild . 
so, what's it shaped like . 
is there a hair on it . 
what happens if you flick it . 
so, uh, does it do anything, you know, special . 
why, yes, ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of narnia . 
you know, in some cultures, having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility . 
you get the best huts, and women dance naked around you . 
huh. are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area . 
you know, you are so amazing. is there anything you don't know . 
ooh, julie's so smart. julie's so special . 
look, honey, i wanted you to hook up with ross as much as you did . 
but he's with her now. you're just gonna have to get over it . 
oh, i'm going to have to get over it . 
god, see, i didn't know that's what i had to do. i just have to get over it . 
whoa . 
sassy lady . 
where are you going . 
um, i'm gonna go meet duncan. he's skating tonight at the garden . 
he's in the capades . 
the ice capades . 
no, no, the gravel capades . 
yeah, the turns aren't as fast, but when snoopy falls? funny . 
i can't believe you're dressing up for him . 
you're setting yourself up all over again . 
okay, no . 
for your information, i'm going to see him so i can put all those feelings behind me . 
and the reason i'm dressed like this is because i think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband . 
darn it, we're all out of milk . 
hey, chandler, will you fill me up here . 
oh, i see, i see. because of the third-nipple thing . 
okay, sweetie, i'll see you later . 
bye . 
see you later, rach . 
bye-bye, julie . 
hey .

hey, come on, cut it out . 
hey . 
what . 
can i ask you something . 
sure . 
eh . 
what . 
come on, talk to me . 
okay . 
what's the longest you've been in a relationship before having the sex . 
why? who's not? are you and julie not . 
are you and julie not having sex . 
wel . 
technically . 
no . 
wow . 
is it because she's so cold in bed . 
or is it because she's kind of bossy, makes it feel like school . 
no. no. she's great. and it's not like we haven't done anything . 
i mean, we do plenty of other stuff. lots of other stuff like no, no, no. don't need to know the details . 
no, it's jus . 
it's me . 
you know, i've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian . 
uh-huh . 
so now i've got myself all psyched out . 
it's become, like, this this thing, and  . 
you must just think i'm weird . 
no. no, no, no. i don't think it's weird . 
i think i think, um, in fac . 
in fact, you know what i think . 
what . 
i think it's sexy . 
sexy . 
let me tell you something. as a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex . 
no kidding . 
oh, yeah. in fact, you know what i'd do . 
i'd wait . 
you'd wait . 
yes, absolutely. i would wait and wai . 
then i'd wait some more . 
really . 
oh, yeah . 
i don't care how much she tells you she wants it, i don't care if she begs she pleads, she tells you she's gonna have sex with another man . 
that just means it's working . 
women really want this . 
more than jewelry .

great. people having sex. that's just what i need to see . 
what's wrong with people having sex .
